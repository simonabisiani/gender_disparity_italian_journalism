I feel as if the breakup has been like a frog being slowly boiled to death</em><em> – I didn’t see it coming and it got progressively worse.</em></p> <p><em>In September, we had a holiday abroad together and he enquired about apartments and asked me to think about whether it was a place I could see myself moving to. We had also agreed that I would come off the pill in a couple of months. He came with me to </em><em>two weddings and my family said how happy we seemed.</em></p> <p><em>Then he visited a friend in the US and came back whingeing that I wasn’t physical enough and we didn’t have enough sex. Since then he has run away from me. How am I supposed to get closure if he won’t speak to me?</em></p> <p><em>Also, money has been an issue. He is on a six-figure salary, and has judged me throughout our relationship </em><em>because I have not sought a better-paid job. Sex has always been bad – and I was willing to fake orgasms for the rest of my life to be with him. It doesn’t make sense because he was never adventurous or willing to talk about </em><em>experimenting or </em><em>switching things up in the bedroom. I am drawing </em><em>the conclusion that he has enjoyed wasting my time and suddenly had enough, but I can’t get over him. He is one of few long-term relationships I have had. He clearly doesn’t give a damn about me. I am mourning the loss of my lifelong need to have a family. I am 39, so my time for children is running out. How do I climb out of this abyss?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>It must be disappointing that your dream of having a family with this man has come crashing down. I’m sorry you are feeling broken-hearted, and angry. You wanted a long-term relationship and a family. You felt time was running out, but then he came along and you found someone to have it with. At that time, you were deaf to the alarm bells.</p> <p>You say he doesn’t give a damn about you. I’m sorry, this is going to sound harsh, but I’m not sure how much you care for him either. I think it may have been more about what this man represented for you – a lifeline to the possibility of realising your ambition of a family. It does sound as if you have been blind to the cracks already showing: sexual incompatibility;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

My manager has recently mandated that we all work from the office on certain days of the week. I now spend half an hour each way crammed into a smelly, dirty train. I started this job during the pandemic, so I was nervous to go into the office and meet my colleagues. Well, my worst fears came true, because on my first day, the first colleague I met tried to get me fired. He said I wasn’t wearing my lanyard and reported it to my boss.</em></p> <p><em>Since then I’ve met the rest of the team and I experienced a not insubstantial amount of sectarianism and sexism. But it’s not just that. I now find I’m hypersensitive to any noise. I’m acutely sensitive to people chewing with their mouths open, slurping soup and gossiping loudly. Not only that, but my stomach rumbles and I find it excruciatingly embarrassing. I want the ground to swallow me up. Working from home, none of this was an issue. I can’t go on like this. Aside from getting a medical certificate, which I obviously don’t want to do, how can I approach my office to request I work from home permanently?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>There are many like you who got used to working from home. Comfort zones for being with colleagues appear to have, in many people’s experience, diminished.</p> <p>During the pandemic, it was repeatedly implied to us that other people were dangerous, potential killers, even. Shops and offices are still full of signs reminding us to keep our distance and wash our hands. Every factual TV series made since the pandemic shows people standing far apart from each other with an unnatural distance. This is all very sensible as a precaution against the virus, but what has it done to our psyches? It has reinforced any anxiety we may have had about others and made us more wary of our fellow human beings. It makes me sad.</p> <p>After so long being on our own, the sounds and smells of other people may very well feel jarring. We got used to the quiet and now normal noise feels horribly over-stimulating and the situation has made us even more conscious of the normal noises our bodies make. Many people report feeling overstimulated and exhausted after re-entry post lockdown. I was among them. Many of us have had to build up again gradually, and I think you will need to do this, too.</p> <p>Like many creatures, human beings are pack animals. If you remove a fruit fly from its fellow fruit flies, isolate it and then re-introduce it into the swarm, it doesn’t plunge back into the centre, but hides around the edges. It is as though it got used to loneliness and dare not risk what might feel like further rejection by diving back in. I’ve heard the same thing happens with rats, and for sure after isolation we humans feel shyer and hypervigilant for potential rejection.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I don’t think you’ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are two things we can do with these feelings of fear and distrust: we can be ruled by the feeling and stay hidden, or we can feel the fear and join in anyway. If we hide, we carry on feeding our fears, but if we dare to feel them and act in spite of them, they will gradually diminish as we establish relationships and re-enter the fray, even when we had believed we would not.</p> <p>I don’t think you’ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard. How kind of your colleague to ask your boss if you had been issued with one (there’s always another interpretation for a story). Forming cliques is universal within all human groups and we won’t educate anyone about sexism by hiding away. It can be awkward joining a group that is already established, as relationships take time. But what is good about them at work is that the cliché of two brains being better than one is true. We can have video meetings, but so much more creativity and problem-solving happens chatting by the water cooler.</p> <p>When you enter a full room and think no one will be interested in you and other people are all horrible, what vibe do you give off? But if you walk in expecting everyone to be kind, interesting and attractive and you are, too, how different would your demeanour be? And what difference would that make to the experience?</p> <p>I doubt there is harm in telling your boss that you work better at home, but it’s not guaranteed to work. I would encourage you, instead, to realise not all humans are all bad, and some of them are really great and will be fun and interesting to work with.</p> <p>You have been searching for evidence to the contrary";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We circled around each other for a summer, but never got together. We did acknowledge our attraction, but were both due to start university</em><em>. After a kiss, we agreed it was bad timing. Out of fear of rejection, I </em><em>never t</em><em>old her how deep my feelings </em><em>went.</em></p> <p><em>We saw each other on university holidays, and an affinity remained, however she quickly appeared to move on. I pined for her deeply. No one I met </em><em>compared. Long sessions of listening-to-depressing-love-songs-type stuff.</em></p> <p><em>I eventually ended up in a relationship. This was fine. It felt like moving on, until N and I got together one drunken evening. Afterwards, we agreed it was a mistake and carried on with our lives. I ended the relationship I was in</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>We </em><em>met a few times over the next few years, but slowly lost touch. I met a wonderful person</em><em> and got married and have </em><em>incredible kids. I </em><em>am very much in love with my wife. My thoughts of my first love remained affectionate, but in a platonic and sporadic way.</em></p> <p><em>I recently found out that N has died, leaving behind a </em><em>family. </em><em>The strength of my reaction has taken me by surprise. I have been completely floored by it and cannot stop thinking of her. I find my mind going to what I could and should have said more 20 years ago. I have only passingly discussed </em><em>this with my wife</em><em>, and not my inner thoughts,</em><em> as I fear it sounds over-the-top and a betrayal to her. How do I rationalise the strength of these feelings I thought I had left behind 15 years ago? I just want to remember N fondly, as she deserves to be remembered.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>I see it like this: you still have that teenage boy inside you, even though you are now a happily married middle-aged man. You need to be very kind to this lovelorn boy: he believes he has just lost the love of his life, he needs to weep and he needs to be held. Luckily, you have a lovely person on-hand to help you with this. You’ve just got to talk to her. Parts of ourselves don’t die just because we move on, they remain dormant until something reignites them. Old men on their deathbeds call for their mothers and you cannot but feel deeply for them.</p> <p>There is a hint in your email that you might be worried about part of you being unacceptable to others. You seem to have some sort of belief that says something like, “If you really knew me, you would not approve of me.” And it seems to me that this might have been part of what held you back from being truly open with N, and now I’m wondering if you are projecting this belief on to your wife. There are lines in your letter that suggest you love your life, and that you love your wife, and because you say things like you thought about N “in a platonic and sporadic way”, I would guess your wife would not be offended if you showed her the email you wrote to me. Maybe even show her my reply, too, because I would think she might be a good person to facilitate your grieving.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>There were things you didn’t say – you need to hear them yourself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are feelings that are difficult to rationalise. That doesn’t mean they don’t make sense. What is wonderful about the bonds we create is that they can go beyond words and this is possibly why we keep trying to articulate such feelings in poetry and love songs. You sound like a rational person, so something you cannot make sense of might feel like a sort of craziness, but I don’t think it is. You certainly did have unfinished business with N";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

How do I find myself?</em></p> <p><em>I worry that I don’t have the right things to say and that girlfriends will either be bored by or put off by what I share, so I share as little as possible (not always, but it is my natural inclination). I also shy away from conflict. I’m not good at expressing myself and I think if I speak, I’ll only make things worse.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>I wonder if you feel that if you are yourself, you may put another person off. But if we never take the risk of putting the other person off, we never give ourselves the opportunity of letting ourselves be known. To be known we have to be seen. We will never be seen if we hide. To truly connect with others we need to be, not who we think we ought to be, but who we really are. You are worried about being boring. In my experience in the psychotherapy room and outside it, people are more likely to be boring when they are not taking the risk of being real. In other words, I want you to work on developing a tolerance for being vulnerable.</p> <p>One of the ways to increase wisdom and connection is to speak in the moment and work out things in conversation, rather than thinking we have to have everything right before we speak. This means not filtering all your thoughts: instead, say, “I love you,” or try to articulate other scary, self-revelatory thoughts without knowing how they are going to land. You can work out how you feel, not always on your own in your head, but in relationship with another. Say things spontaneously for the first time before you’ve thought them through. Practise being yourself and being unsure how you’ll be received. Dare to share. Is this a fail-safe formula? No. It is a risk. But without allowing ourselves to be really seen, a potential partner won’t be able to really connect with us. So, in my view, it’s a risk worth taking. </p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Speak in the moment rather than filtering all your thoughts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In response to our earliest environment, we develop coping strategies and these become ingrained habits. What may have got you through early on – may have even earned you the appellation of “good boy!” – might have been “sharing as little as possible”. But what might have been a self-preserving policy in the past can become a self-defeating policy in the present. You say not sharing is your “natural inclination”. It could be just early adaptation, therefore ingrained rather than natural.</p> <p>Adapting to other people is a skill, and I suspect one you have in so much abundance that you might have lost some of yourself. Some people need to learn how to adapt and turn up the adaptation dial, while others – you seem to be among them – need to turn it down. If you adapt so completely to the other person, there is nothing left of you for them to have a relationship with. It is even hard for you to have a relationship with yourself. I expect you are putting in more energy to work out the other’s feelings than giving yourself attention to figure out your own.</p> <p>Perhaps conflict is difficult for you because you have difficulty in knowing what you feel. Conflicts are usually far more about how we each feel than they are about facts. There will be conflicts in any relationship as we all experience things differently. It’s better if we can think of differences, not so much as I’m right, they’re wrong, winning and losing, but as an opportunity to gain understanding of the other’s view point and to communicate how you feel about yours. Then, considering your and their feelings, work together for compromise. If conflict is completely avoided, not talked about, never aired, a relationship can shrink because, as subjects become taboo, it means there will be less and less to talk about and areas of loneliness creep in where each of you remain unseen.</p> <p>I’m wondering if you are numb where feelings are concerned. You don’t say how you feel about your break-up. Perhaps you learned to numb emotion because to have your feelings meant having pain. Trouble is, we cannot just numb hurt and pain without numbing joy as well. I think you need to work on turning up your feelings dial. You don’t have to go from zero to 10";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our kids will pick up on how we are feeling and are likely to mirror our own emotive state. Even if you don’t mean to expose them to news, children will realise that something is going on. It may not concern younger children at all but those who are a bit older or old enough to have a smartphone may well be worried, and even work themselves up into a bit of a frenzy.</p> <p>For a greater proportion of their lives than ours, they have lived with the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak"">pandemic </a>and have been isolated for long periods of time from their peers. On the whole, this <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/social-workers-warn-of-rise-in-mental-health-problems-among-children"">has not helped their mental health</a>.</p> <p>So it is bad timing that they are now surrounded by war reporting. We cannot deny what is going on. Keeping secrets, speaking in whispers will only make them paranoid and more pessimistic.</p> <p>If you want to talk to your children about anything you might find emotionally charged, including war, it is a good idea to ask them what they already know about it. If they ask questions, you won’t know all the answers and that’s OK – you can look things up together and throw in a lesson at the same time about what is a reliable source of news.</p> <p>There are three main ways we deal with feelings, ours and our children’s. We either repress and minimise them or we are completely at their mercy and maximise them, or there is the middle way where we acknowledge and contain them. It will be no surprise to you that I am in favour of the middle way. It is trickier to negotiate than the other two, which we may be more naturally inclined to lurch towards. It takes thought and practice.</p> <p>Open, honest dialogue with children will help them to put into words how they feel. The more they can put into words, the less likely anxiety will show itself in tummy aches and/or inconvenient behaviour. It isn’t appropriate to say, “we are all doomed and the apocalypse is imminent”, nor is it desirable to tell them everything is perfectly fine";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In those days, treatment was harsh, drug-based and punitive in tone. I recovered to live a fulfilling life. I was married for 30 years, raised two children, worked as a teacher and ended my career as head of a large comprehensive school. After my husband died, I had to unravel the records and finances of his company and close it down, which was stressful and sad. He had been ill before he died and I had been his carer. Since then I have sold the family home and moved to start a new life near the sea. I have done everything I should – joined the church, a local choir, a gym and made friends with neighbours. However, lockdown happened in the middle of my move and I have had to spend a great deal of time alone. To cut a long story short, my old problem came back and has taken me over. My daughters live far away and both have families of their own. I miss them, they want me to visit, but I make excuses because I fear not being able to hide the anorexia from them. I’m stuck, obsessed with staying “empty”. I am absolutely terrified because I cannot seem to control this – it makes me happy to feel free of food. Even though I want to stop, I don’t want to stop.

I’ve suffered my fair share of trauma in my childhood and adult life and have some health issues. The problem I have right now is that my anxiety levels are so high that every morning I am frozen in fear. I struggle to get washed and dressed and have no motivation to get up and go. But it isn’t really just that</em><em>. I feel physically sick at the thought of leaving the safe confines of my bedroom. I tend to watch the same TV shows for escapism over and over again. The only time I truly feel safe is at night when everyone is asleep and I’m alone – the world is quiet and it’s just me. I fear disaster and fear people expecting things of me. I am scared I will be trapped in their expectations and I won’t be able to meet them. I’m so demotivated at work and struggle to actually perform as I should. I have a high-pressure job and feel deeply insecure all the time. What can I do?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>Telling me about this might not have been easy. I admire you for taking that step. Here is another: I want you to notice your breathing. Stop reading this for 10 seconds or so and notice how you breathe. OK, take 20 seconds now, and it doesn’t matter if it’s longer or shorter than that – I really want you to notice the in-breath and then your out-breath. This is you having contact with yourself in the present. When you notice how you are breathing, do you slow your breathing down? Before you get up in the morning, lie in bed being aware of your breath for a minute or two. Your attention will wander;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When we feel heard we don’t have to shout louder. Echoing back what you’ve heard so you don’t ignore them will calm things down. If they say something like, “Doctors can’t help me” you don’t have to argue, you can just respond with, “Ah, you feel doctors can’t help you.” After you’ve both agreed that they believe doctors can’t help, you might say, “I would be so much less anxious if you gave the doctors another try.” This will be experienced by them differently than the more combative, “You should…” because you’d be defining yourself and not them.</p> <p>There is much less logic to any of our thoughts than we’d like to believe.

I have been in a relationship with a patient and kind man – but it hasn’t always been easy, mostly because of my insecurities.

I want it to stop. I could end up in court. I let such a good thing go and I will never find that again.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> I have hope because you have clarity about your situation. You are not blaming your ex and want to examine your own behaviour and impulses. This is commendable. You are on the right track.</p> <p>We want our children to lead their own lives, but that doesn’t mean we don’t feel deserted when they leave home. This may be a contributing factor to your recent behaviour change.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Your behaviour seems to say: ‘I hate you, don’t leave me’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You say: “I don’t recognise myself any more.” First, you need to rule out anything medical. Make an appointment with your GP and tell them exactly what has happened. It could be that a sudden drop in oestrogen, which happens during the menopause, has made you debilitatingly intolerant. Or perhaps you are on medication that is affecting you badly. It’s unlikely, but you may even have suffered some sort of brain damage so that your impulse control is shot. Perhaps alcohol is also causing you to lose control. Or it could be something else, or a combination of the above… so make that appointment. They can also refer you to a psychiatrist or mental health team.</p> <p>You mention insecurities. I expect this means you have a deep fear you will be abandoned and might need more reassurance than most, which can be experienced by others as overly demanding and may lead to arguments.

I have been in a relationship with a patient and kind man – but it hasn’t always been easy, mostly because of my insecurities. We went away and I spoilt things by starting fights and, consequently, he decided to end it. Up until this episode, I was a friendly, easy-going, non-confrontational person. The problem is that I don’t recognise myself any more. When the relationship finished, I was out of control. I had created so much drama and upset, mostly drink-fuelled. I made accusations against him at his work and he nearly lost his job. I didn’t stop there. Overwhelmed by a compulsion and driven by anger, I messaged his friends and slated him on social media so much that he threatened legal action. I am scared about my unpredictability and lack of control. How can I be so full of hatred, vengeance and spite? My mother, who is dead, was a difficult person and it is her unpredictability that I think I am playing out. I don’t want to become her. I want it to stop. I could end up in court. I let such a good thing go and I will never find that again. Philippa’s answer I have hope because you have clarity about your situation. You are not blaming your ex and want to examine your own behaviour and impulses. This is commendable. You are on the right track. We want our children to lead their own lives, but that doesn’t mean we don’t feel deserted when they leave home. This may be a contributing factor to your recent behaviour change. You say: “I don’t recognise myself any more.” First, you need to rule out anything medical. Make an appointment with your GP and tell them exactly what has happened. It could be that a sudden drop in oestrogen, which happens during the menopause, has made you debilitatingly intolerant. Or perhaps you are on medication that is affecting you badly. It’s unlikely, but you may even have suffered some sort of brain damage so that your impulse control is shot. Perhaps alcohol is also causing you to lose control. Or it could be something else, or a combination of the above… so make that appointment. They can also refer you to a psychiatrist or mental health team. You mention insecurities. I expect this means you have a deep fear you will be abandoned and might need more reassurance than most, which can be experienced by others as overly demanding and may lead to arguments. When you do not get this extra reassurance, the desperation you feel can drive you to lash out. Alcohol may be fuelling this, too. You may have felt that your ex was the sole cause of your suffering. Your behaviour seems to say: “I hate you, don’t leave me.” You cannot manipulate or bully your way into a healthy relationship and, when the red mist clears, you know that.

Eighteen months in, I left my wife, feeling sure my affair partner was the love of my life, and in the hope it might lead to us being together. This led to the loss of my home and much of my social network, and the need to change jobs.</em></p> <p><em>My affair partner decided to stay in her marriage, citing the wellbeing of her children. She wanted to keep the relationship with me going indefinitely in secret. This rapidly became unbearable to me and I have now cut off all contact, which was not her wish.

Her final message to me expressed that this was now her intention, but that she could give no sense of a timescale. </em></p> <p><em>I have told my wife absolutely everything and she has been phenomenally sane. She is offering to have me home, for a trial period, with a view to mutual kindness, leading to either reconciliation or a better parting. There was much of value in our shared life. </em></p> <p><em>I know that the rational thing to do is to assume my affair partner will never be able to be with me, but I still love her and think of her with hope. I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence with anyone else. Every day, a part of me wants to reach out and tell her this, for the millionth time, to try to win her. I obsess about it. Another part of me wants to have no contact. My life is stuck</em>.</p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> “I wouldn’t want to belong to a club that would have me as a member,” said Groucho Marx. What is the pull of a potential partner who is not committing to you? What is this about? Did you have to work hard to get the approval of a parent? Did a teacher you had a crush on withhold praise? Have you had a pattern of falling for unavailable lovers, those who lived abroad, or were already married?</p> <p>I want you to think about your longing. At the moment, you are your longing, your longing is you, you are it. Take a step back from it. Look at it in a detached way. You’ve told me: “In my whole life, I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence.” And I’m tempted to prompt: “What about your mother when you were two?”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The trouble with what is familiar in this way is that it feels right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now this might sound far-fetched, but look at the way a toddler wants their parent. Notice the clinging, the desperation, the longing: it’s all there. I’m guessing you may be haunted by an inner ghost of that baby or toddler who longed and longed and sometimes had the ecstasy of being momentarily held, in an intermittent way that reinforced the longing and made you long all the more.</p> <p>The trouble with what is familiar in this way is that it feels right. Sometimes people say love feels like “coming home”, like coming back to what is familiar, from a time even before words could explain that familiarity. You learned how to long – like a sort of default mood for you – before you knew any words.</p> <p>The love you have with your lover sounds like a “falling in love” type of love. The type we see in films where you are swept up in a passive way: it happens <em>to</em> you. Very much, really, like it happens to a baby or a toddler, they don’t <em>do</em> anything, they fall into longing. But the love your wife is showing you? Wow! That is a different sort of love altogether. That isn’t passive, that is love as a verb, that is love as an action, that is the sort of steady, committed, available, consistent kindness that, had you experienced it as a toddler, I don’t think you’d be in this situation now. That is probably the love you need, rather than the one you think you want.</p> <p>What would I advise you to do?

Whenever we meet someone, the small talk inevitably turns to “And what do you do?” For now, I am ready for that question. I am a teacher.</em></p> <p><em>Although there is </em><em>satisfaction from the work there is also the mental load of overseeing not only the education of pupils, but increasingly their welfare</em><em>, and I struggle to juggle responsibilities of family and work</em><em>. I regularly think about packing it in for something that does not take up so much headspace. Being a teacher is how I have defined myself for </em><em>20 years. How could I square it with myself, if I had to describe myself with a non-professional job? I can’t imagine saying “I stack shelves” or “I work in doggy daycare.” When I try to discuss </em><em>it with my dad, he says he would be “disappointed because I like telling people you are a teacher”.</em></p> <p><em>I know I have asked my own children about what they would like to do when they are grown up and maybe I’ve unintentionally shown more approval when they lean towards something professional, but I now realise that all I want is for them to be happy. So, how do I find the courage to just be me, without a label? And how do I instil this into my daughters</em><em>?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> So, if I understand the question, the problem is not who you are with yourself – you’d be happy working as a dog walker or stacking shelves – it is how you identify yourself to others and the weighty problem of your dad’s supply of small talk.</p> <p>I’m imagining you working at the supermarket, taking on colleagues’ problems. Or at doggy daycare worrying about a dog’s fleas that his owners don’t seem interested in. I can guess, in other words, you will be taking your work home, whatever it was, because you care, it’s what you’re like. I’m guessing you have a capacity to take on problems – probably quite efficiently – and that if you empty your head of some of them, you’d find others to fill up that headspace. We get into these habits that take awareness and willpower to shift.</p> <p>Now, you could stay in a profession that does afford you satisfaction, but learn how to be boundaried with yourself so you bring less of the headspace aspects of it home. But perhaps you are more fed up with it than that, and the only thing stopping you leaving is what other people might think.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Small talk is big talk in disguise. It’s asking: Are you friendly?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You say you can’t leave your job because your dad’s small talk would run dry. That is the best non-reason I’ve ever heard (and I’ve heard a lot). Thinking about you chatting with your dad about the possibility of changing jobs is making me smile. I think this is probably because, whatever your mental load, you also have a sense of fun.</p> <p>In terms of how others may see you, I reckon you get invited out a lot because people want you around as you are delightful and not because you are a professional person. If you really want a less responsible job, sure give up the teaching, you’ve done your time and duty, you can have a new adventure. Your experience and work to date will not be wasted – it has made you what you are today. It can still inform your small talk.</p> <p>Small talk is big talk in disguise. When we ask about the weather or what someone’s work is, what we are really saying is, “I’m friendly, are you friendly?” or “Can I get on with you?” but it’s too weird to say that, so “What do you do?” remains our stock phrase. And it’s not what we say in reply that matters – and I cannot stress this enough – but <em>how</em> we say it.

I’m wondering whether this is limiting my life. Whenever we meet someone, the small talk inevitably turns to “And what do you do?” For now, I am ready for that question. I am a teacher. Although there is satisfaction from the work there is also the mental load of overseeing not only the education of pupils, but increasingly their welfare, and I struggle to juggle responsibilities of family and work. I regularly think about packing it in for something that does not take up so much headspace. Being a teacher is how I have defined myself for 20 years. How could I square it with myself, if I had to describe myself with a non-professional job? I can’t imagine saying “I stack shelves” or “I work in doggy daycare.” When I try to discuss it with my dad, he says he would be “disappointed because I like telling people you are a teacher”. I know I have asked my own children about what they would like to do when they are grown up and maybe I’ve unintentionally shown more approval when they lean towards something professional, but I now realise that all I want is for them to be happy. So, how do I find the courage to just be me, without a label? And how do I instil this into my daughters? Philippa’s answer So, if I understand the question, the problem is not who you are with yourself – you’d be happy working as a dog walker or stacking shelves – it is how you identify yourself to others and the weighty problem of your dad’s supply of small talk. I’m imagining you working at the supermarket, taking on colleagues’ problems. Or at doggy daycare worrying about a dog’s fleas that his owners don’t seem interested in. I can guess, in other words, you will be taking your work home, whatever it was, because you care, it’s what you’re like. I’m guessing you have a capacity to take on problems – probably quite efficiently – and that if you empty your head of some of them, you’d find others to fill up that headspace. We get into these habits that take awareness and willpower to shift. Now, you could stay in a profession that does afford you satisfaction, but learn how to be boundaried with yourself so you bring less of the headspace aspects of it home. But perhaps you are more fed up with it than that, and the only thing stopping you leaving is what other people might think. You say you can’t leave your job because your dad’s small talk would run dry. That is the best non-reason I’ve ever heard (and I’ve heard a lot). Thinking about you chatting with your dad about the possibility of changing jobs is making me smile. I think this is probably because, whatever your mental load, you also have a sense of fun. In terms of how others may see you, I reckon you get invited out a lot because people want you around as you are delightful and not because you are a professional person. If you really want a less responsible job, sure give up the teaching, you’ve done your time and duty, you can have a new adventure. Your experience and work to date will not be wasted – it has made you what you are today. It can still inform your small talk. Small talk is big talk in disguise. When we ask about the weather or what someone’s work is, what we are really saying is, “I’m friendly, are you friendly?” or “Can I get on with you?” but it’s too weird to say that, so “What do you do?” remains our stock phrase. And it’s not what we say in reply that matters – and I cannot stress this enough – but how we say it. I can imagine you at a party in a year’s time when you have given up teaching, being asked what you do and you replying something like, “I have the best job in the world. I’ve bought a jet washer and spend my days making people’s patios as good as new. It’s so satisfying, the only trouble is the work experience boy I’ve got working with me for a week is terribly unhappy as he is going through his first romantic breakup, I’m very worried about him…” I wonder how many of us are doing responsible, professional jobs when we’d rather be, say, taking people’s dogs for walkies. Not for financial reasons, but just because we worry what new people will think when we define ourselves in social situations. Remember small talk is the big question of “Are you friendly, can I get on with you?” and all you have to be is friendly when you reply. If you get really stuck, you can go, “You first…” If they tell you they are a teacher and are getting bogged down with all the changing rules and requirements, I’m sure you’ll be very simpatico. And how can you teach your own children to be happy? You can’t. But if you accept them and their ideas as they are, you will be helping to instil confidence and a capacity for happiness.

Five years ago, I got involved with a married man with two kids. </em><em>The relationship </em><em>was intense, hyper-sexual and obsessive. I felt uneasy and tried to end it many times</em><em>, but was always easily persuaded otherwise by him</em><em>. He started living separately from his wife two years back and there was terrible heartache with the children going back and forth. I was getting unhappier, more neurotic, and not in control of my see-saw emotions.</em></p> <p><em>Then the pandemic brought immense trauma. First, my mother died, swiftly followed by my father</em><em> and then, in the second wave, my sister-in-law also died of </em><em>corona</em><em>virus. I have become entwined with my brother’s life, helping him resurrect a routine, looking out for his two daughters.</em></p> <p><em>In the midst of all that, I felt I didn’t need to live with what had become a gnawing, unhappy situation with the married man. I tried to explain to him, but I think he’d become so used to me ending it that he thought it’ll be like other times when we would argue and then make up. But I really did finish it this time. I stopped calling him, didn’t respond to his messages. That was three months ago. I feel better for it and am in a more stable space, but feel bad because sometimes I think I have been unfair in ending it like that. Was I hasty? Do I need to meet him and have a rational conversation?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>You have borne a lot of loss and I’m sorry. But I’ll address what you asked me, should you meet your lover again?</p> <p>It seems you were in the habit of ending things with him and then getting back together again. You remind me of a person determined to stop smoking. She knows it’s bad for her, will damage her health, but without ever even putting it into words she finds herself lighting another cigarette;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

She’s been engaged for five years. The whole thing has had to be rearranged twice due to the pandemic and now it’s on for 2022.</em></p> <p><em>When she became engaged, I was one of her only mates</em><em>. We had been teenage friends and used to go out drinking and partying</em><em>. She started working and became sensible and ambitious, met her fiancé</em><em> and settled down. I went to college, met a bunch of people I bonded with </em><em>and we started to drift apart. She asked me to be her bridesmaid more than four years ago and I think it was because at that time there were not many other people she could ask.</em></p> <p><em>Since then, our friendship has continued to diminish. She refuses ever to meet on week nights because of work and doesn’t like to go out on the weekend any more</em><em>. I go to her house for a cuppa about twice a year</em><em>. She talks wedding plans, we do a rudimentary catching up, and then I leave. We don’t speak for months at a time. We don’t share any interests, we don’t have any other friends in common. I haven’t even met her fiancé because she has told me that we won’t get on. Neither of us has really put any time or effort into our friendship</em><em>. Unfortunately, she cares strongly about the perfect wedding, another thing which we don’t agree on. My dilemma is this: I am working a</em><em> low-pay job</em><em> and cannot afford a four-day hen do abroad. I want to get out of this responsibility</em><em>. I do not want to go to the hen do, be a bridesmaid, or even go to the wedding. My friends tell me to grin and bear it, that it’s only a few days, but </em><em>I have never wanted to escape a situation more</em><em>. </em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> You are reminding me of that Reba McEntire track, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ETqzcEGzk"" title="""">I’d Rather Ride Around With You</a>, about a bridesmaid who jumps into a sports car with her boyfriend when she should have been at church holding the bouquet for her cousin, the bride. It’s a great story-song, have a listen.</p> <p>You are expected to make good your promise. She wants the perfect wedding and you fit the perfect bridesmaid role. The bride even has a cup of tea with you twice a year (to be fair we have had lockdown) to keep you primed for this role.</p> <p>It will be horrible to be the “bad person” in this and the extraction process will be unpleasant, but the relief of not having to go through this charade will make up for that.</p> <p>What your friends haven’t realised is that it’s not just a few days of the hen do and the wedding that you lose if you go through with this, but all the days leading up to it as well. Your life at the moment seems to be tarnished with background dread. If you get yourself out of this situation, you will get back more than saved money and a few days, you’ll also free yourself from months of this trepidation.</p> <p>How about sending her a letter: “Dear X, I am really sorry, I know I promised all those years ago to be your bridesmaid and a good person would keep good her promise. But as your wedding approaches I find myself not wanting to be a bridesmaid, not wanting to join the hen do and not even really wanting to go to the wedding.

She’s been engaged for five years. The whole thing has had to be rearranged twice due to the pandemic and now it’s on for 2022. When she became engaged, I was one of her only mates. We had been teenage friends and used to go out drinking and partying. She started working and became sensible and ambitious, met her fiancé and settled down. I went to college, met a bunch of people I bonded with and we started to drift apart. She asked me to be her bridesmaid more than four years ago and I think it was because at that time there were not many other people she could ask. Since then, our friendship has continued to diminish. She refuses ever to meet on week nights because of work and doesn’t like to go out on the weekend any more. I go to her house for a cuppa about twice a year. She talks wedding plans, we do a rudimentary catching up, and then I leave. We don’t speak for months at a time. We don’t share any interests, we don’t have any other friends in common. I haven’t even met her fiancé because she has told me that we won’t get on. Neither of us has really put any time or effort into our friendship. Unfortunately, she cares strongly about the perfect wedding, another thing which we don’t agree on. My dilemma is this: I am working a low-pay job and cannot afford a four-day hen do abroad. I want to get out of this responsibility. I do not want to go to the hen do, be a bridesmaid, or even go to the wedding. My friends tell me to grin and bear it, that it’s only a few days, but I have never wanted to escape a situation more. Philippa’s answer You are reminding me of that Reba McEntire track, I’d Rather Ride Around With You, about a bridesmaid who jumps into a sports car with her boyfriend when she should have been at church holding the bouquet for her cousin, the bride. It’s a great story-song, have a listen. You are expected to make good your promise. She wants the perfect wedding and you fit the perfect bridesmaid role. The bride even has a cup of tea with you twice a year (to be fair we have had lockdown) to keep you primed for this role. It will be horrible to be the “bad person” in this and the extraction process will be unpleasant, but the relief of not having to go through this charade will make up for that. What your friends haven’t realised is that it’s not just a few days of the hen do and the wedding that you lose if you go through with this, but all the days leading up to it as well. Your life at the moment seems to be tarnished with background dread. If you get yourself out of this situation, you will get back more than saved money and a few days, you’ll also free yourself from months of this trepidation. How about sending her a letter: “Dear X, I am really sorry, I know I promised all those years ago to be your bridesmaid and a good person would keep good her promise. But as your wedding approaches I find myself not wanting to be a bridesmaid, not wanting to join the hen do and not even really wanting to go to the wedding. I realise by extracting myself I’m not being a great friend to you and I’m sorry. It’s not just that I can’t afford it and I can’t, it’s that I don’t want to be there. I can’t put on an act and I don’t want to spoil your day by not being enthusiastic. I hope you have a wonderful day and I’m sorry. Love from… PS Sometimes being authentic means I’m not as kind as I would wish to be, sorry.” If you need permission to break your promise, I am giving it to you. And if you need an excuse to justify your actions to yourself, it seems she has only wanted to spend time with you lately on her terms and you have to come to her.

We have now been dating for nearly two years, sometimes on Zoom as we live three hours away from each other. This is long-term relationship potential – except, from my side, for one thing.</em></p> <p><em>I am a deeply sexually alive person. Sex is an immense joy to me. Not only the explicit physical acts of it, but also the sharing, the play, all the openness and openheartedness</em><em>. Tom is divorced and I suspect has not had much sexual experience</em><em>. I think he is sexually repressed. I have always been open with him about wanting our relationship to become fully sexual. It never has been</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Tom has a serious heart condition and </em><em>wants everything we have, minus a full sexual relationship, for fear </em><em>of his heart, although his doctor has given him the green light and said he’s fine to use Viagra. It </em><em>troubl</em><em>es </em><em>me that Tom responds to my talking about wanting a full sexual relationship in </em><em>offhand ways, uncaring about my needs and wishes</em><em> – in every other way he’s the person I have been waiting for.</em></p> <p><em>It seems like a no-brainer: I should leave. But we are compatible in every way other than this, including intellectually. We are both in our early 70s – when it’s far from easy to find a compatible partner. The grief of not having sex again would be immense, plus maybe underlying resentment would likely erode my regard for him</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>I fantasise about finding a part-time lover, to live that part of who I am, while being with Tom for the rest of my life in every other way. Would Tom go for it? Maybe, but I </em><em>doubt it.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> I do believe that someone who does not want to have sex should not be pressured into it. Yes, this might be heartbreaking and frustrating for their partner, but we are each responsible for caring for our own bodies and discovering what we each need. You talk about yourself as a sexual person and wanting a sexual relationship in general, but you don’t really talk about your sexual attraction to Tom in particular. If I were Tom, I might sense that you wanted to make love, but perhaps not necessarily to me and this would put me off. No one wants to feel used. Of course, this is conjecture on my part, but I flag it up in case it may be relevant.</p> <p>He is, you say, uncaring about your needs and wishes, but only around the subject of sex. Perhaps you are being uncaring about his boundary around this as well. Calling him “repressed” could be being callous, too, though I know you are not being so purposefully.</p> <p>The partner relationships we have could be seen in phases. They look a bit like this:</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>You cannot reason with someone about not wanting to have sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>1. Pre-sexual, not co-habitating<br>2. Sexual, not co-habitating<br>3. Sexual, co-habitating<br>4. Post-sexual, co-habitating</p> <p>Tom may have got to stage 4, and you have not. He may want to want you as his significant other, but he doesn’t want to have sex. It’s as though, for whatever reason, he’s over that. The reason he has given is health. It’s unfair on him for me to speculate further. The trouble when we are given reasons instead of feelings for a decision is that we can argue with the reason, but really, it’s his feeling. He just doesn’t want to. That needs respecting.</p> <p>Your solution: “I fantasise about finding a part-time lover, to live that part of who I am, while being with Tom for the rest of my life in every other way.” Maybe this will be your solution. It seems unfortunate for you that you be put into stage 4 when you could do with a bit of stage 2 or 3.</p> <p>You cannot reason with someone about not wanting to have sex: that is pressurising them and it isn’t right. And you are not ready to forego sex. Talk about your proposed solution with Tom and see what he thinks. Maybe you can be very close friends, always in each other’s lives, but not necessarily partners. You don’t have to cut him out of your life.</p> <p>On the other hand, you don’t know how this relationship will pan out";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I recently met a woman on a dating app after being single for a year since the start of the pandemic. She’s a similar age to myself and we’ve been dating for two months. She’s very attractive and nice, and we have a good time together – she can make me laugh. There is a red flag, though. Although she is in her mid-20s she still lives at home and seems to have no plans or ambitions to move to living independently. Plus, despite having a part-time job, she doesn’t contribute to the household bills. Now I understand that rent is high and people are staying with their parents for longer, but she isn’t even planning on going to college or progressing further in her career. She spends most of her money on going out with friends, holidays and hobbies. My friends and family say that she’s a waster who will drain me of money if we ever move in together as she has never lived life like an adult, never had to budget or think about bills, and that I should ditch her. I can see their point, but I’m having a great time with her. It is hard to know what I should do. What would you advise? Philippa’s answer Your friends and family love you and fear for you.

Maybe the bombardment over most of your lifetime, with images, hate and stories from her that seem to rot away inside you, so that you do not want to examine it and sort it out. But I think you must. I think you need to list what your mother said about your father, list the stories of the affairs she told you about, organise the secrets she has dumped on you with dates, put them in order. This is how you take control of it, so it isn’t swimming about in you. I suggest you cannot do this all in one go, but in stages, a little every day.

It isn’t a healthy way to behave in relationships, but nothing brings two people closer than having a common enemy. This might be how she learned to be close to people.

But whatever course you decide, it would be good to feel in charge of everything that has been put on you, rather than that poison being in charge of you.

Our challenge in circumstances like these is to not lose our faith in the inherent goodness of most people.</p> <p>When a pack animal is taken from their group and isolated then reintroduced, they don’t throw themselves back into the centre, they stay on the periphery, don’t take risks and they stay relatively isolated. This experiment has been done with rats and with fruit flies. And I don’t think humans are much different. Isolation and loneliness makes us wary of others, distrustful. If something happens once or twice we can experience it as a pattern, and we withdraw to protect ourselves from it happening again. We become wary of being vulnerable to shield ourselves from further rejection. And we can make very reasonable-sounding excuses to do this – just like you presented me with your evidence. Reasoning can become our enemy when we use it to back up our instinct to shy away from new people after a period of isolation.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Our task is to not lose faith in the inherent goodness of most people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But we have the edge on fruit flies and rats because we can also use our powers of reason to override those instincts which tell us to hide. We can lead with the brain instead of with our instincts.</p> <p>There is also the danger of the self-fulfilling prophecy. If you go to a gathering of people and you think as you enter the space, “Nobody likes me, no one wants to talk to me, relationships are meaningless,” how would that show in your body language? What vibes would you be giving off? You’d probably stay on the edges, avoid eye contact and be guarded in any conversations. Now suppose instead you think, “Everyone is interesting and attractive and pleased to see me and I’m interesting, valuable and attractive. I want to talk to them about what I’m thinking, and I want to find out what they are thinking about,” then how would that show in your face, body language, eye-contact and the vibe you give off? It’ll make you more approachable, friendlier and relatable.</p> <p>Both scenarios are speculative fantasy but I <em>always</em> say if you are going to have a fantasy about other people make it a good one. Make it the best one and believe it and it will show in your face and it will turn your life right around. How do I know this will work for you? I cannot possibly know, but I believe it. I’ve done it, my clients have done it and I get very excited about it. If you cannot do it, go to a hypnotherapist until you can. Reprogramming yourself from “everyone is horrible” to “everyone is lovely” can make the biggest difference in your life. You may find it easy or it might take all your courage to flip this switch. You’ll need to turn your attention away from the evidence you’ve cherrypicked which backed up the stories you used to tell yourself about relationships and look the other way towards hopefulness and evidence that some seeds do germinate (but they won’t if you don’t sow them).</p> <p>Now, repeat after me: “everyone is interesting and attractive including you and me and we are all very pleased to see each other”. It will take practice. You have acclimatised to “everyone is not worth the effort” because you’ve practised that. Time to upgrade to your next self-fulfilling prophecy. We only have one life (apparently) – don’t be a fruit fly. </p> <p><em>If you have a question, send a brief email to <a href=""mailto:askphilippa@observer.co.uk"">askphilippa@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>";58;885;2021-11-14T15:45:00Z;TRUE;2021-11-14T05:00:26Z;FALSE;TRUE;2021-11-14T16:29:31Z;14/11/21;UK;The Observer;https://www.theguardian.com/p/jgtfg;FALSE;TRUE;https://media.guim.co.uk/d74e64a152ca2df35e49ba950ce4373402dd21a7/712_674_4340_2605/500.jpg;FALSE;en;TRUE;The dilemma I’m only now able to get back into society after 20 months of having to isolate.

We can have some bad experiences dating, or with people we thought were friends and it’s natural we think that this is a pattern and that all experiences will be like this in one way or another, proving to you that humans are somehow bad, and relationships meaningless. Our challenge in circumstances like these is to not lose our faith in the inherent goodness of most people. When a pack animal is taken from their group and isolated then reintroduced, they don’t throw themselves back into the centre, they stay on the periphery, don’t take risks and they stay relatively isolated. This experiment has been done with rats and with fruit flies. And I don’t think humans are much different. Isolation and loneliness makes us wary of others, distrustful. If something happens once or twice we can experience it as a pattern, and we withdraw to protect ourselves from it happening again. We become wary of being vulnerable to shield ourselves from further rejection. And we can make very reasonable-sounding excuses to do this – just like you presented me with your evidence. Reasoning can become our enemy when we use it to back up our instinct to shy away from new people after a period of isolation. But we have the edge on fruit flies and rats because we can also use our powers of reason to override those instincts which tell us to hide. We can lead with the brain instead of with our instincts. There is also the danger of the self-fulfilling prophecy. If you go to a gathering of people and you think as you enter the space, “Nobody likes me, no one wants to talk to me, relationships are meaningless,” how would that show in your body language? What vibes would you be giving off? You’d probably stay on the edges, avoid eye contact and be guarded in any conversations. Now suppose instead you think, “Everyone is interesting and attractive and pleased to see me and I’m interesting, valuable and attractive. I want to talk to them about what I’m thinking, and I want to find out what they are thinking about,” then how would that show in your face, body language, eye-contact and the vibe you give off? It’ll make you more approachable, friendlier and relatable. Both scenarios are speculative fantasy but I always say if you are going to have a fantasy about other people make it a good one. Make it the best one and believe it and it will show in your face and it will turn your life right around. How do I know this will work for you? I cannot possibly know, but I believe it. I’ve done it, my clients have done it and I get very excited about it. If you cannot do it, go to a hypnotherapist until you can. Reprogramming yourself from “everyone is horrible” to “everyone is lovely” can make the biggest difference in your life. You may find it easy or it might take all your courage to flip this switch. You’ll need to turn your attention away from the evidence you’ve cherrypicked which backed up the stories you used to tell yourself about relationships and look the other way towards hopefulness and evidence that some seeds do germinate (but they won’t if you don’t sow them). Now, repeat after me: “everyone is interesting and attractive including you and me and we are all very pleased to see each other”. It will take practice. You have acclimatised to “everyone is not worth the effort” because you’ve practised that. Time to upgrade to your next self-fulfilling prophecy. We only have one life (apparently) – don’t be a fruit fly.

You had a great life, stressful, but you seemed to thrive on the adrenaline. You scooted around the world having fleeting contact with a great number of friends and had a long-distance relationship. That has all changed and the change was outside your control. You have suffered three significant losses: the death of your father, the end of your relationship and a curtailing of your previous lifestyle. You are allowed to grieve, feel these losses and give yourself time to get over the shock of them and time to adapt to a different life. I’m not surprised you feel less than great. Sure, you are neither broke, friendless nor homeless, but that doesn’t mean you are not suffering.</p> <p>How you relate with people has also altered. Pre-pandemic the norm for your social life seems to have been lots of brief contact, but now everyone around you is getting into deeper connections. And perhaps a long-distance relationship suited you, too. More excitement when you infrequently got together, rather than taking time to know each other on a more meaningful level?</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Your family, you say, doesn’t need you any more.

Did you mourn or did you just comfort the mourners? You are allowed to be vulnerable and sad, too. Your family, you say, doesn’t need you any more. That doesn’t mean that you are not allowed to need them. You don’t always have to play the role of the strong one. I wonder whether you tell yourself it isn’t appropriate for you to have needs as well?</p> <p>At work everyone is happy with you when you are doing almost nothing. I’d go further, I’d bet your family is happy with you when you do absolutely nothing. You belong";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The problem is that I haven’t been happy in my career for a long time and have felt very stuck, and every now and again I end up crying because I just don’t know what to do with my life. I was an over-achiever at school (worked hard, got the grades, went to a good university), but am now in a role where there is little progression and I’m not sure I even want to stay in this career.</em></p> <p><em>I am realising that I have spent so much time trying to do what is expected of me that I have absolutely no idea what it is that I want to do. I also cringe at how much I put up with in my 20s. I chased men I knew deep down I didn’t really like and took on all kinds of extra tasks at work with the promise that it would look good on the CV, but got few promotions.</em></p> <p><em>I feel relieved I am at least finally aware of this behaviour, but I am terrified that it is too late. I have been applying for jobs, but there are not many firms that want a mother approaching 40. And, like I say, I’m not sure I even want to stay in this field. Please help.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>Isn’t it great that your relationships with your partner and your child are working out? Sounds like you had an epiphany back there and stopped going for people you thought you should go for and instead went for someone you liked and loved. Good work. Makes me confident you can do the next bit of self-development work you need to do as well.</p> <p>So again, it’s time to examine your “shoulds”. “Shoulds” are so often the assimilated wants of other people and of your culture. Soaking up all these introjects, you assumed you should work hard at school, should go to university, should work in a competitive industry, should rise to the top. Tramlines that suit many people, but they by no means suit all and I’m glad you are listening to your own feelings now because this means you will be able to make the adjustment you need in order to face in the right direction.. You have been ticking the boxes you were expected to tick by others, but they haven’t all been, until now, necessarily your boxes.</p> <p>I think your fear comes from your having in mind a sort of board game of years and milestones – of what milestone you should reach by what year. This is grounded in those shoulds you’ve absorbed. This is not a helpful game. A friend of mine co-founded a new creative industry business at 80 (<a href=""https://www.natthecat.co.uk/"" title="""">natthecat.co.uk),</a> so don’t think you’ve lost the game if you have got to a certain number without a particular milestone – you don’t need to play that game. Find another game.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The biggest risk is staying in a place that makes you unhappy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading your email, I cannot be sure if it is the not-rising-to-the-top that is distressing you, or the work itself. I’m not sure if you are unhappy because of a relative lack of status and an inner voice saying, where is my promotion? Or whether this unhappiness is about the nature of the work itself. I wonder if you can unpick and separate the two.</p> <p>I think up until now, as far as work goes, you have been working hard at being seen to be doing the right thing, doing things for your CV rather than for satisfaction in the present. You need to internally reference more, that means working out how things feel to you, and do less external referencing – which is how things look to others. Things need to be less about how they appear and more about how they feel. You know this, but I’m spelling it out – the more we put this stuff into words the easier it is to handle.</p> <p>If you like the work, but don’t appreciate the lack of advancement, that could be about staying in your industry, but finding another group of people to work with who are a better fit for you. Turn what you see as disadvantage into advantages – being a parent means that you use your time well and can prioritise";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The “living through to the end is killing me”: you have no control over the cancer, no wonder you want whatever control you can have. Do whatever you need to do to make your living to the end more bearable. If I was your next of kin, I would want something of you to cling to for a while. I would also like a manual of me to give to a next partner because that might just be the permission I needed to move on. It is not mad. It is beautiful. Oh, and put a notice on the door so the cat doesn’t get run over. It won’t be able to leave a manual.

We house-sit for my daughter and her family wh</em><em>en they are away. They have dogs, </em><em>but don’t like to put them in kennels. We have always got on well with our granddaughter and indulged her, along with her brothers. But she is spoilt. Last month while we were there </em><em>to house-sit, </em><em>there was shouting between her and my husband. She didn’t like the fact that my husband had disciplined our dog when we arrived – but our dog was jumping up.</em></p> <p><em>I know my husband has a short temper, but it blows over quickly. Her reaction was over the top. She stormed off</em><em> and wouldn’t look at him. She asked him to leave the lounge as she wanted to watch a film. She actually arranged for a friend to call every two days to check the dogs were being looked after OK, as if we are untrustworthy. She texted me to say we were not to go into her room and she referred to my husband by his name and not “Grandad”.</em></p> <p><em>My daughter and her husband ignored her behaviour. I think they should at least tell her off. She owes her grandfather an apology.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> I’m guessing that in your day you had to respect your elders, no matter what, and it really doesn’t seem right or fair that your granddaughter not only doesn’t respect you but doesn’t hide it. She shouted back at the patriarch! She didn’t trust you with the dogs!</p> <p>If we over-indulge someone, it is not their fault that we do, so how can we use the word “spoilt” as an insult? I suppose we mean “entitled” and there seems to be a fair bit of entitlement going on in Grandfather for sure.</p> <p>Her parents, wisely, in my opinion, let her get on with her own relationships with you and the patriarch (because that is what I’m calling Grandfather for now) without interfering. Your granddaughter is an adult and she’s allowed to say what she feels.</p> <p>And perhaps the patriarch could allow himself to say something like the following to her: “I have been reading about ‘dog whispering’ and tried it out and my dog is behaving much better now. Thank you for showing me there was another way. And I really should not have shouted at the dog and nor should I have shouted you down. I’m used to being in charge and I need to realise that I can have equal relationships where I allow myself to be influenced by others, even if they are decades younger. In my day, dads and granddads knew it all, and yet it was all bluff – I sucked it up, but when I reflect on it I realise I was taking their dominance of me out on you. I really don’t have to carry that on for another generation…”</p> <p>Or something like that and then I’m sure you will all get on just fine.</p> <p>It is natural to pass down what was done to you. And it’s not his fault because until he becomes aware that there is another way of looking at this situation, he will not realise that he has a choice about how to train dogs and how to relate to younger people.</p> <p>It is essential for you and your husband to remember how it felt to always be dominated, squashed, “disciplined” when you yourselves were younger. And if you can’t, if you think being shouted down was “fine” it is because you were dominated so much that, in order not to be completely crushed by it, you became desensitised to it. When you are desensitised, you mind it less, you get over it quickly and then shouting has less of an effect on you. But if you haven’t been desensitised, it won’t blow over quickly.</p> <p>Granddad might recover fast, but it doesn’t follow that those who are subjected to his shouting do. Many of us, when shouted at, experience fear. We have feelings of shock and adrenaline as if we have been subjected to physical, rather than just verbal violence. And it is very natural when you feel you are attacked, to attack back. I’m not surprised she couldn’t bear to have him in the room. She would’ve been tense – not knowing when he was going to explode again.</p> <p>The teenage and young adult brain is all wired up for emotions. They feel things in colour;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I’ve got great friends and family, but I need an outsider’s take.</em></p> <p><em>I was seeing a man, for a few months. This ended around eight weeks ago. He was unhappy living in this country and had plans to move even before we met, which he was always very open about, and I was aware the entire time that he was emotionally unavailable and planning to leave. So I feel I should have been prepared for the end of the relationship when it happened.</em></p> <p><em>For about a month I felt OK about it. I was thinking about him less and less each day and was considering dates with other men. But now, I feel things have started to go backwards and I can’t understand why. I now feel more heartbroken, lost and sad than ever before. I think about him almost constantly</em><em>. I miss him more than I ever thought possible. My heartbreak is disproportionate to the amount of time we spent together.</em></p> <p><em>I always felt I would never be in danger of unrequited love. But, now that he is gone I feel completely crushed. I want desperately to be free from this feeling.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>You managed your feelings for a whole month by overriding them with your logic, but sometimes trying to suppress a feeling is like trying to contain water in a paper bag. It is not a long-term solution. What’s happened here is the Mrs Logic part of you is trying to tell you what you should be feeling, but the feeling part of you is having none of that. It might not make sense to you that your heart is broken, but that alone, unfortunately, will not make this flood of feelings subside. Humans are more complicated than equations – we have emotions that we cannot make sense of and I’m afraid you must accept that even though you rationally think it most unreasonable, you experienced his going as a great loss.</p> <p>Sticking with the water metaphor, the paper bag has burst and the water is overflowing. But now you are going to take control of the tap. You will need to open the tap and let the feelings out otherwise the pressure will build up – but you are going to control where and when. You do this by setting a timetable for it. Weep, rage and mourn at the same time every day for half an hour. In fact, you must mourn and grieve then, even if you don’t feel like it. But the rest of the time when you find yourself regretting, yearning, wanting, weeping, obsessing, you must instead concentrate on your breathing. Notice your out-breath, then the in-breath. Then slow down your out-breath, but breath in normally. Next take your focus to the top of the breath, the time when you are neither inhaling nor exhaling, then to the bottom of the breath. Your mind will wander, the tears may still sting, but each time, take your focus back to your breath.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>In your daily grieving half-hour, you can weep, rage and mourn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other activities you can do when the unrequited love threatens to invade are complicated mathematical problems, crosswords and other logical “right-brain” activities. On first awakening, if you find yourself brooding, jump out of bed and exercise with a video, concentrating on the instructions and getting out of your mind and into your body. Another good distraction is doing a realistic, observed pencil drawing of your shoe. Don’t worry what the drawing looks like, but concentrate on the looking at the shoe, observing it, recording all the details. It will require your full concentration.</p> <p>In your daily grieving half-hour, it’s time to reminisce about your relationship. You could make a shrine";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

My doctor said it was nothing and dismissed me.</em></p> <p><em>My husband </em><em>showed no interest in me, we barely talked or had sex, I</em><em>’d try to get his attention with meals or looking nice, </em><em>and he</em><em>’d get angry and tell me all was fine and why did I wear my depression like a badge of honour? At times, I felt suicidal.</em></p> <p><em>Around this time, I met another man. We ended up in an extramarital relationship.</em></p> <p><em>I spoke to a suicide helpline and the lady I spoke to was clearly unhappy with me. I felt absolutely lost. I knew my affair was wrong, but seemed powerless to stop it. This man told me I was nothing more to him than sex. He would ignore me for weeks and in my low state I would wonder why. It took me four years to get up the strength to end the affair.</em></p> <p><em>After it ended, my husband heard a rumour about it and I confessed. He was rightly furious with me for weeks. I offered to give him a divorce, but he said no. He refused couples counselling and said he wanted to stay together, but things have never been right</em><em>. He won’t discuss it. This happened six years ago and I cannot forgive myself for the hurt I caused. Can you help unravel my feelings?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>The counting of the years, 22, 10, 6, 4… I am reminded of a prisoner in a cell, crossing off the years they have been incarcerated. I feel you are in some sort of subconscious prison and I want you to escape.</p> <p>You had a problem, you were suicidally depressed. Your husband did not seem to value or relate to you. You needed to be valued even if it was just for your body, and this would make you vulnerable to being prey. You sought the solution to your problem through another man. Had you not taken that temporary measure, how else would you have solved your problem? No one was listening. You were suicidal, but you took the better option. It was a desperate measure, but you were desperate.</p> <p>Another problem you may have been trying to solve with the affair was not being taken seriously by your husband – on some level you may have needed him to find out to try to get through to him.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>You deserve individual therapy and you need it now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We often seek partners who make us feel the same emotions we felt when we were around the people who brought us up. When we meet someone who evokes these feelings, it can feel like a spark, because we confuse what seems like good chemistry with what is familiar. And, if we never seemed to get it right for our first caregivers, psychically this can feel like unfinished business, so we seek partners for whom we cannot get it right, with the wish that this time we will succeed, so the unfinished business can be laid to rest. But this unconscious strategy does not work. In this way your childhood can still hold you prisoner and you do not escape to become independent, but seek other jailors instead.</p> <p>I am not getting a sense of your wants or even needs. You offered to give your husband a divorce, but this was not what he wanted. But what do you want? Do you want a divorce? Have you ever been allowed to know what you want? I’m guessing what you think you desire is for the other to be happy, and to be happy with you. And you will contort yourself into any shape to try to please, losing yourself and your own wants and needs in pursuit of this. It’s not working";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He stopped when the teacher told him off. The friend has moved on, forgiven him and even invited him to his birthday party, but it is haunting my son as he still feels bad and really anxious about it. What happened was very much out of character and he can’t explain why he did it. Here is my son’s letter to you: I am a nine-year-old boy. A couple of months ago, I hurt my friend by squeezing his neck tight. I don’t know why. Maybe I was overtired. Now I deeply regret this and have been feeling guilty almost every day since. I apologised and I keep apologising. The boy I hurt forgave me quickly, but I can’t seem to forgive myself.

My relationship with her tends to be </em><em>strained. She lost her husband before I met my partner. I know he did an awful lot for her</em><em> – I can’t help but think she feels </em><em>I am taking her son away from her. Her behaviour towards me is often petty, she rarely even tries to make small talk</em><em>. The way she behaves makes me feel </em><em>I want to spend as little time with her as possible. She has a tendency to make the atmosphere </em><em>sour. She seems </em><em>increasingly selfish and she hasn’t offered to help with our wedding at all. She is spending a great amount of time and money on her appearance, she is obsessed with dieting. </em><em>It makes me feel </em><em>as if she is trying to compete with me.</em></p> <p><em>I</em><em> get upset when I hear about friends getting on well with their mothers-in-law. </em><em>It is unlikely </em><em>we will ever have a close bond, but I don’t want my partner and I to start our married life </em><em>in this way. He seems </em><em>oblivious to it all. What can I do to help ease the tension?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer</strong></em> It is quite possible she is worried that she will see less of her son and maybe such fears are not without foundation. She might well be harbouring resentment about this possible loss of time with him and it won’t be her beloved son she’ll begrudge – so her antipathy might well be coming your way.</p> <p>How are you going to ease the tension?</p> <p>In a situation like yours most of us can all too easily see ourselves as being the goodie and the other as being the baddie, and then we naturally select the evidence to fit. We intensify our feeling of dislike by cherrypicking only the evidence that backs up our hunches. This makes us feel right, or even self-righteous, and we thus construct a negative lens through which to view the other – making them into the bad guy. So, your first job is to put aside the dynamic of one of you being good and the other bad. This task becomes easier when we become aware of how we interpret the other’s behaviour.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Say you are not at ease and would like to get on better with her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you look at her actions in a positive rather than a negative light you can get different meanings from them. For example, “She hasn’t offered to help with the wedding” rather than selfishness, could be interpreted as not wanting to interfere. And her not wanting to make small talk might not be because she is in any way bad but because she is shy, or awkward or doesn’t know what to say. Shyness can easily be mistaken for haughtiness. She spends a lot of money on her appearance and diets – she might not think her appearance is good enough, she may feel inadequate, insecure or even unacceptable. Quite often people who may appear vain because they obsess about their appearance are really the opposite.</p> <p>To get to the nub of the matter of your relationship I would recommend a different sort of talk than the small kind. I wonder whether you would feel able to risk saying something like: “I feel nervous around you, I guess it’s because I really want to get on well with you and know you, yet I don’t feel it’s going so well. What is it between us that seems to stop me being friends with you?” I don’t want to put words in your mouth – use your own words, but speak in “I” statements, which define your own experience and not “You” statements. So never tell her what you think she is like, but you can say how you are not feeling at ease and would like to get on better with her. When a step is taken to be more vulnerable and open in a relationship, the other person often follows suit. It is a risk. I wonder whether you will take it.</p> <p>Bear in mind that it might be sad for her that her son is getting married. She may feel it’s another loss and compounds the loss of her husband. The wedding might be an occasion where she will miss the support he would have given her. If you don’t think she would find it intrusive, check out assumptions like these with her, too.</p> <p>I hope you will be able to find a way to talk to her about your relationship with her – maybe the two of you could get to the point where you could share what you would wish from your relationship going forward. Perhaps she might confide that she fears losing one-on-one time with her son";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I was very much in love with my ex-boyfriend for the first three years</em><em> of our relationship</em><em>. Problems started </em><em>when he asked me to marry him. I felt us disconnecting and asked to go and see a relationship counsellor</em><em>. It didn’t help. He said some things in session that still smart today. For example, he said our partnership was like a whining child he wants to run away from. I became more distraught about the deterioration of the relationship as he became more distant.</em></p> <p><em>The wedding plans stalled. The final straw was him arranging a big holiday with his friend and I was not consulted or invited. I was desperate and one day after he’d insulted me, I </em><em>said I was ending it. Once I’d calmed down I tried taking that back, but he wasn’t having any of it. I never saw him again.</em></p> <p><em>Personally and professionally I am now doing well. But I’m still haunted by feelings of grief</em><em> and I worry </em><em>I’ll not make it to a place where I no longer feel the pull. </em><em>I need him to reach out and say he misses my friendship. I’ve had other relationships since that one, but I always have a sense that I’ll never fully recover and will never fully be present in my life. Please don’t tell me I’m immature.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>I’m guessing your ex had what we call in my profession an “avoidant attachment style”. This means that he wouldn’t like to get too close – he might think he would, but he wouldn’t. People develop this style when they have learned in infancy that they cannot depend on others to soothe them. They solve that problem by unconsciously deciding (even before they can speak) that they will never need anyone. He likened your relationship to a whining child. I might assume he finds the human need for connection frightening and/or repulsive to some extent.</p> <p>But, for me, the real alarm bell went off when you decided to get married – until that commitment was on the horizon he was able to manage a relationship, but afterwards he saw it as a drain. It is not uncommon for people who have an avoidant attachment style to shy away from a relationship when it becomes more committed – even if they have initiated the commitment. This is not your fault, which I think you know. You, on the other hand, may have what therapists call “insecure attachment style”. People with this style are often attracted to avoidants. It feels right because it feels familiar: one of the main emotions you felt growing up was probably this longing you still feel now. Insecurely attached people are good at longing, and a lover who is likely to trigger it is someone who swerves commitment – someone with an avoidant attachment style.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>This man may have been very special, but everyone is very special in their own way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You probably longed for a parent and you experience this longing as love. Someone gorgeous who can never fully be there for you will ignite your fire. And now you think, if only I could have a crumb, just him saying he misses my friendship, I would be all right. This man may have been very special, but everyone is very special in their own way. What makes someone an object of your longing, of your love, is the fit.

I was very much in love with my ex-boyfriend for the first three years of our relationship. Problems started when he asked me to marry him. I felt us disconnecting and asked to go and see a relationship counsellor. It didn’t help. He said some things in session that still smart today. For example, he said our partnership was like a whining child he wants to run away from. I became more distraught about the deterioration of the relationship as he became more distant. The wedding plans stalled. The final straw was him arranging a big holiday with his friend and I was not consulted or invited. I was desperate and one day after he’d insulted me, I said I was ending it. Once I’d calmed down I tried taking that back, but he wasn’t having any of it. I never saw him again. Personally and professionally I am now doing well. But I’m still haunted by feelings of grief and I worry I’ll not make it to a place where I no longer feel the pull. I need him to reach out and say he misses my friendship. I’ve had other relationships since that one, but I always have a sense that I’ll never fully recover and will never fully be present in my life. Please don’t tell me I’m immature. Philippa’s answer I’m guessing your ex had what we call in my profession an “avoidant attachment style”. This means that he wouldn’t like to get too close – he might think he would, but he wouldn’t. People develop this style when they have learned in infancy that they cannot depend on others to soothe them. They solve that problem by unconsciously deciding (even before they can speak) that they will never need anyone. He likened your relationship to a whining child. I might assume he finds the human need for connection frightening and/or repulsive to some extent. But, for me, the real alarm bell went off when you decided to get married – until that commitment was on the horizon he was able to manage a relationship, but afterwards he saw it as a drain. It is not uncommon for people who have an avoidant attachment style to shy away from a relationship when it becomes more committed – even if they have initiated the commitment. This is not your fault, which I think you know. You, on the other hand, may have what therapists call “insecure attachment style”. People with this style are often attracted to avoidants. It feels right because it feels familiar: one of the main emotions you felt growing up was probably this longing you still feel now. Insecurely attached people are good at longing, and a lover who is likely to trigger it is someone who swerves commitment – someone with an avoidant attachment style. You probably longed for a parent and you experience this longing as love. Someone gorgeous who can never fully be there for you will ignite your fire. And now you think, if only I could have a crumb, just him saying he misses my friendship, I would be all right. This man may have been very special, but everyone is very special in their own way. What makes someone an object of your longing, of your love, is the fit. He gave you what you longed for because your earliest caregivers probably ignited more longing than security in you. Your relationship ended and no one has ever fitted quite as well. Except if they did, the pattern would be repeated. You can recover. You will come to appreciate people who are there for you. Go over your very first attachments with the people who brought you up – or who didn’t, but should have done – and see how this man pushed ancient buttons. What is addictive about love with insecure attachment people are the highs, which are only possible because there are lows. What would you give for a hit of him right now, saying he misses you? Then he’d disappear again and the lows and longing return. To move on, what you’ll need to do is recognise that your type is not your type. Your type of partner isn’t the avoidant type who will give you these highs, followed by lows, but someone who is reliable, available and dependable. What we call a “secure attachment” type. And it won’t be love at first sight because he won’t seem familiar in the way an avoidant person would be, but he’s reliable.

She may be feeling as if she is a specimen to be analysed and researched – something to be right about rather than a person to relate to. And anorexia can be the body’s way of trying to solve a problem that has not been articulated and quite often after psychological investigation that problem seems to be the patient’s lack of autonomy in their life.

I’m getting a clue from your saying sex has never been regular. In many marriages, instead of being two adults, partners switch between being in parental or childlike roles. Having sex with this parent-child dynamic may make the whole thing problematic. You both seem to be switching between the roles of parent and child. She takes the role of child-like patient. You take care of the research like a parent, but then you’re like a kid in the back of the car asking, “Are we nearly there yet?” when it comes to sex and then she switches to a withholding parent role. The guilt about masturbation is also strangely child-like.</p> <p><strong>3</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> You are having the problem – no sex – but you see your wife as the one having the problem. How was it decided that your wife would be the sick one? What’s happened to your problems? With all your caring focused on your wife it makes me wonder about your inner child. Perhaps you were neglected and never want your wife to feel like that, or you had an overbearing parent who micromanaged you. Perhaps this was your blueprint for a loving relationship. What was it about your upbringing that, at 51, has left you with hang-ups about masturbation? It can be so much easier to see what needs fixing in someone else than it is to realise what it is in ourselves that may be limiting our own lives and relationships.</p> <p><strong>4</strong>. Too much rescuing. In our culture, we big up men and boys to be knights in shining armour and downplay girls and women into damsels in distress, so it’s too easy to take it for granted that it’s the male role to problem-solve. But it isn’t. Think about it: if your dog is run over, you’d rather someone felt for you in your grief than advised you on how to hold a dog lead. So if someone says they are having, say, hot flushes, rather than trying to take control of the situation with research about the female body in general, instead be curious about her unique personal experience. There is also a flavour of I-want-to-get-you-right-for-me about the fixing that I expect she picks up on.</p> <p>I cannot predict what is going to happen and neither can you.

Your friend has some cheek!” This wasn’t life-saving surgery and it was something she could have afforded anyway. I can see how unfair that might feel to you – but then I wondered, what does life feel like for her?</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>My first thought on reading your email was, 'Crikey! Your friend has some cheek!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Maybe she feels “it’s not fair” that she has this illness. It’s not logical to try to redress the balance by asking her friends for money, but when we are in crisis we may not be thinking logically so much as acting from an unexplored impulse. How is your friend coping with the unfairness of her illness? Under such circumstances many other “it’s not fair” thoughts can also invade: “Why me?” “Why now, why not later?” “Why do I get punished?” “It’s not fair that I may die when others live.”</p> <p>She could feel unbalanced by such inner messages and a way to try to get justice and redress the balance maybe through the metaphor of money. It might feel that somebody else is paying for her sorrow, her fear, her pain. It is not easy to face the idea of dying. It is easier to displace those feelings into anger, rage and wanting revenge against the world. I don’t believe she will be consciously trying to punish or trick you, but unconsciously she may feel she needs to take from the world to make up for what has been taken from her.</p> <p>Redressing the balance like this, feeling as if you are still in control, can push down troubling thoughts like: “Who will be there when I die?” “How can I need another person?” I doubt very much this re-balancing was done in a scheming way. Power is about control, planning and not needing anyone, not having to trust another fully.</p> <p>Another force is love. If we are not frightened to love, love is a big source of comfort, especially in times of illness and vulnerability. And maybe your friend really wanted to ask you for love, but did not know how to make herself even more vulnerable than she felt already. It may have felt easier to ask for money. Or maybe this was the only way she could put her real needs into words. I wonder if she also finds it too hard to realise that she needs people. When all is fine, we can feel in power, but power is only one force of life. When we are powerless, we need love more than ever, but may think that money will do instead. Especially if we have been brought up to think that money is more important than people. It never is. It can only be a substitute. It sounds as though she does not realise this yet.</p> <p>She might be telling you and herself about her crypto currency trading account as a way of saying: “I wasn’t in control, my illness was in control, now I am getting control back.” My feeling is she told you because unconsciously she still feels it is not enough. She needs you, she needs friends, she needs love.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>She needs you, she needs friends, she needs love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So maybe you may want to reach out to her, maybe share why you have felt more distanced from her lately and how you cannot believe she knowingly wanted to trick you and your friends to part with money you and they needed. Have a conversation about how money can make you feel secure but not secure enough, because what you really need is not so much the money of your friends but their love, their being there while you go through hard times, and maybe their love, company and support as you go through end times too.</p> <p>Until we know where someone has come from and how their mind has been trained by their culture to operate in the world, until we know how they experience what they are going through, we need to suspend judgment and give them the benefit of the doubt.

It is all compounded by the fact she recently told me she is now trading crypto currency online. I feel like she has played the sympathy card in order to avoid dipping into savings. Philippa’s answer My first thought on reading your email was, “Crikey! Your friend has some cheek!” This wasn’t life-saving surgery and it was something she could have afforded anyway. I can see how unfair that might feel to you – but then I wondered, what does life feel like for her? Maybe she feels “it’s not fair” that she has this illness. It’s not logical to try to redress the balance by asking her friends for money, but when we are in crisis we may not be thinking logically so much as acting from an unexplored impulse. How is your friend coping with the unfairness of her illness? Under such circumstances many other “it’s not fair” thoughts can also invade: “Why me?” “Why now, why not later?” “Why do I get punished?” “It’s not fair that I may die when others live.” She could feel unbalanced by such inner messages and a way to try to get justice and redress the balance maybe through the metaphor of money. It might feel that somebody else is paying for her sorrow, her fear, her pain. It is not easy to face the idea of dying. It is easier to displace those feelings into anger, rage and wanting revenge against the world. I don’t believe she will be consciously trying to punish or trick you, but unconsciously she may feel she needs to take from the world to make up for what has been taken from her. Redressing the balance like this, feeling as if you are still in control, can push down troubling thoughts like: “Who will be there when I die?” “How can I need another person?” I doubt very much this re-balancing was done in a scheming way. Power is about control, planning and not needing anyone, not having to trust another fully. Another force is love. If we are not frightened to love, love is a big source of comfort, especially in times of illness and vulnerability. And maybe your friend really wanted to ask you for love, but did not know how to make herself even more vulnerable than she felt already. It may have felt easier to ask for money. Or maybe this was the only way she could put her real needs into words. I wonder if she also finds it too hard to realise that she needs people. When all is fine, we can feel in power, but power is only one force of life. When we are powerless, we need love more than ever, but may think that money will do instead. Especially if we have been brought up to think that money is more important than people. It never is. It can only be a substitute. It sounds as though she does not realise this yet. She might be telling you and herself about her crypto currency trading account as a way of saying: “I wasn’t in control, my illness was in control, now I am getting control back.” My feeling is she told you because unconsciously she still feels it is not enough. She needs you, she needs friends, she needs love. So maybe you may want to reach out to her, maybe share why you have felt more distanced from her lately and how you cannot believe she knowingly wanted to trick you and your friends to part with money you and they needed. Have a conversation about how money can make you feel secure but not secure enough, because what you really need is not so much the money of your friends but their love, their being there while you go through hard times, and maybe their love, company and support as you go through end times too. Until we know where someone has come from and how their mind has been trained by their culture to operate in the world, until we know how they experience what they are going through, we need to suspend judgment and give them the benefit of the doubt.

A paper that consisted of readers’ questions and the answers. His idea was that readers could send in dilemmas to be answered by a panel of experts, the Athenian Society. But his great innovation was that they could do so anonymously and this has remained a feature of problem pages ever since. Poor old Dunton could have done with some advice himself, because he ended his days in poverty as he was a better innovator than he was a business person. He blamed his woes on other people rather than taking responsibility for his own failings. I think an agony aunt today might have spotted that for him and possibly saved him from destitution.</p> <p>His panel of experts, depicted as 12 learned men with him in the centre in an engraving at the top of the pages, were largely fictitious. It was just Dunton and a couple of mates who went through all the letters in a coffee shop.</p> <p>He might have been the first agony uncle to have made up characters to answer problems, but he was not the last. <em>Jackie</em>, a teen magazine published from the 1960s through to the 1990s, had Cathy and Claire answering the letters, except, and I hope this isn’t a shock to you, Cathy and Claire did not exist. It was the job of whoever happened to be the most junior member of the writers’ team to teach readers how to practise kissing on the back of your hand, before you had a go on a real boy.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""7aaff4d8a883e425e349ada0e649ab5aac07ef34""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/7aaff4d8a883e425e349ada0e649ab5aac07ef34/264_833_2531_3164/800.jpg"" alt=""Jackie magazine, the 1977 annual.

Whisper it, but agony aunts Cathy and Claire were not real people.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Johann Knox/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Magazines may have become creative with making up fictional people to answer the letters, but what I rarely came across in my research into the problem page are made-up problems. The only instance I found was a porn magazine conjuring up salacious questions to spice things up. Even the letters in <em>Jackie</em> were never made up – and they’ve certainly never been less than genuine at the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The big difference between agony aunts then and today is that now we have the internet to answer those tricky problems about how to eat an avocado pear (a lot of letters in the 70s were avocado-related), what to do about spots and how to remove stains from carpets, so these days the problems we are left with are the personal ones, and it may be surprising how little these have changed over the years.</p> <p>Deidre Sanders, who I interviewed for <em>Sex, Lies and Love Bite</em>s, a 2015 BBC4 documentary, told me that over the three decades she had been answering letters sent to the <em>Sun</em>, people do not change much and that in her experience most of the letters were still about love, relationships and reassurance.</p> <p>There is one problem we do not see mentioned so much these days, though. In the 1690s, John Dunton was told: “Sir, I’ve addicted myself to a most grievous sin, though I refrain from the commission of it while I’m awake, in my dreams I commit and take pleasure in it.” In the 1970s a reader of Claire Rayner’s column in <em>Petticoat</em> magazine wrote: “I am 16 and I have masturbated all my life. Lately, I told a friend about it and she was horrified and said I would become blind… I can’t believe I have ruined my life about this.” Rayner got angry in response – not at the reader, but at the “stupid destructive rubbish they had been lumbered with… masturbation is not wrong.” She may have had the final word on the subject because this is one problem that I never saw in all my years as the agony aunt at <em>Red </em>magazine.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""905de76c8263f339c293697b5545c20dddc9ab6c""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/905de76c8263f339c293697b5545c20dddc9ab6c/29_32_986_1233/800.jpg"" alt=""Sunny outlook: Deidre Sanders, who spent decades answering letters at the Sun."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Sunny outlook: Deidre Sanders, who spent decades answering letters at the Sun.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Martin Pope</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had a great time with the problem page at <em>Red</em> and I cannot tell you how delighted I am now to have been offered this opportunity to be the agony aunt for the <em>Observer Magazine</em>. I would have loved to tell my younger self as she lapped up Cathy and Claire and <em>Petticoat</em> magazine, imagining how she would answer, that she would one day achieve her ambition of having the privilege of replying to your dilemmas.</p> <p>Now that we have Google and Alexa for more practical advice, the problem page is left for talking about ourselves. We like to read it because we are curious about other people. Our circumstances will differ, culture changes over time, but simply by being human we are not unalike.</p> <p>Agony aunt columns, then and now, speak to what we have in common – and what we don’t. They answer a fundamental paradox: we need both to feel as if we belong and are normal, yet at the same time we want to feel individual and unique. The columns help with both these needs at once. Other people’s dilemmas and the replies may resonate with us. And when they don’t, they give us the opportunity to compare ourselves in relation to what is being discussed.</p> <p>Our minds are formed in relationship with the people we grow up with, as well as the wider culture. And within families and outside them, other people’s interests will often diverge from our own. This creates inner and interpersonal conflicts. And this is another reason the problem page has never gone away: all of us must cope with such differences.</p> <p>Maybe your children won’t talk to you, or perhaps your parents don’t leave you alone. It could be you never like work or you love it to the detriment of everything else. You may feel depressed, numb, anxious, overwhelmed or angry. It could be that your relationships or other people are the problem. Or maybe it’s you. So, what can you do about that? Whatever is on your mind, I want to know about it, reflect upon it, possibly learn from it and share my thinking on it. I hope I can help you see things from another perspective, or validate your own. Whatever you are going through, however freakish or ordinary, someone will think “That’s me.” Not every email or letter will be used in the column, but every correspondent will help me know what is concerning people at any given time.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""1dec9f0d19ad577aa6e7f239da966f64f5fc52e5""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/1dec9f0d19ad577aa6e7f239da966f64f5fc52e5/0_1169_7818_4691/1000.jpg"" alt=""Philippa Perry: ‘Here am I asking you to tell me what unsettles you.’"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Philippa Perry: ‘Here am I asking you to tell me what unsettles you.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may take courage to write down what’s bothering you and then send it in. You may feel there is a risk you won’t be taken seriously, be ignored, told off or misunderstood. And then there’s the risk of embarrassment, which does not kill us, but feels like it might. Sometimes humiliation feels so unendurable that the problem is that it hasn’t. And yet, here am I asking you to tell me what unsettles you.</p> <p>When people are stuck, often I find they don’t know they have a choice about how they could respond to their world. So, unthinkingly, they react. Or sometimes they can overthink things so much that they freeze. These are just two of the countless ways we get entrenched in old and unhelpful patterns. But there are also many approaches that can help us progress. And we need them because when it comes to solutions, one size does not fit all. I hope consulting me may unlock some of them.</p> <p>When I respond, I’ll draw upon the theories used in therapy. I believe the research and wisdom of such concepts are useful to everyone. I want to spread psychotherapeutic knowledge beyond the confines of the therapy room. It is not my aim to look clever at your expense, or to in any way shame you if you write in. My goal is to understand and help you get unstuck, and in the process maybe help other readers, too.</p> <p>Writing to an agony aunt is not counselling and can never replace it, as I’m sure you know. Just as you don’t have one weight training session and emerge from the gym with a six-pack, a course of therapy takes at least several weeks and often years. Psychological change is not unlike building up muscle. Thinking differently about something or making a change in how you relate to yourself or others takes time and experimentation. When you have therapy your practitioner is there as the support and a witness through this process.</p> <p>One of their most important roles is being able to bear what you have to say. You may also learn to experience yourself differently in relationship with the therapist as they mirror back to you aspects of yourself you may be unaware of. As someone on the other end of a computer, I can’t do that. But being a psychotherapist has taught me that people grow in their own way and in their own time, in an environment where they can be themselves and where they are allowed to experiment with who they can be – as opposed to someone, or themselves telling them who they should be. So my approach will be along these lines. I aim to be alongside you rather than opposing you. It won’t be therapy, but it may still be helpful. Writing down a dilemma, knowing someone is going to read it, is useful in itself. My definition of good advice is having something put into words that you have always known, but have never before articulated. When you hear it, or read it, it resonates with you and you think “YES” and things fall into place, even just a little. Obviously that is what I hope I’ll achieve in this column. But you will be the judge of that.</p> <h2>A lifetime of good advice</h2> <p><em><strong>Jay Rayner, son of Claire, greets Philippa with his own family story of letters and lunch</strong></em></p> <p>The first time I met the <em>Observer Magazine</em>’s new agony aunt, it was to discuss agony aunts. The psychotherapist Philippa Perry was making a documentary for BBC4 looking at the history of advice columnists and wanted the skinny on my late mother, Claire Rayner. We met at the LSE, where Claire’s papers are held, and pored over one of her ‘standards’ books, the collection of adaptable-form letters she had compiled to help deal with questions that came up repeatedly. What was immediately striking about Philippa was her level of engagement. She was fascinated by the minutiae of people’s lives";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Within a week, the second world war was under way in Europe.</p> <p>“Over the Rainbow” was the most popular piece of music in 1939, and has become shorthand for that bittersweet sense of being in tough times and walking towards better ones. Yip Harburg’s heartfelt lyrics speak of hope, but so does Harold Arlen’s music – and when the tune jumps a whole octave within the elongated “some-<em>where</em>” it flies over a metaphorical rainbow of seven notes to land on the eighth. And it is that leap that really <em>feels </em>like the essence of hope: half rooted in reality, half up in the sky. Half present, half future. Part Kansas, part Oz.</p> <p>Of course, 1939 and 2021 are very different years. And sure, the felt-tip rainbows children drew in support of the NHS had become faded and sun-bleached long before the second wave of the pandemic crashed to shore, but hope is still in demand. The trouble is, hope can be hard. For every buoyant thought about vaccines, it is easy to sink back into a black hole of news and ongoing catastrophe. And it seems impossible sometimes to resist the downward gravitational pull of new strains and scary statistics and the sheer social, economic and psychological magnitude of all this.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>This last year has shown us that, despite our collective flaws, we don’t easily give up on a better future</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is easy to feel, quite literally, hopeless. We might actively try to resist it and stay inside the low octave of pessimism. As gloomy old Nietzsche saw it, hope is the absolute “worst of all evils” because it prolongs our torments rather than relieves them. But that is defeatist, and this last year has shown us that, despite our collective flaws as a species, we don’t easily give up on a better future. I prefer Anne Lamott’s idea of how hope “begins in the dark – the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come”. Because that is the thing about hope. Its stubbornness. It is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson"">Emily Dickinson</a>’s singing bird perched in the soul that <em>never stops at all. </em></p> <p>This actually gives hope a very real and practical purpose. Far from it being a Nietzschean torment, something that dangles like a carrot eternally in front of a donkey’s nose, reasons for hope can be found not just <em>after </em>despair but inside it. In the face of this slow-moving tragedy we have been living through, we have seen so many acts of everyday goodness and courage, in hospitals and care homes and on our own streets.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TOBzT-1LfU""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8TOBzT-1LfU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Arguably the most hopeful song of the 20th century arrived in arguably its darkest year.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Maybe, then, the hope we could work to cultivate is less the passive cross-fingers-and-wait variety, but more the look-for-the-rainbow kind, or the sleeves-rolled-up-and-make-it-happen kind. In desperate times, beauty shines brighter. I can remember reading about how Steven Callahan, a sailor who was adrift at sea for 76 days, noticed through pain and hunger the sudden majesty of the night sky. He wasn’t noticing this beauty <em>despite </em>his life being in peril but <em>because </em>of it.</p> <p>In depression I used to cling to such moments, even as the weight of illness pressed into my mind. Beauty shone like a promise of another world within this one. Even amid the collective trauma of this year, it is also still possible to detect a collective hope. “It is in collectivities that we find reservoirs of hope and optimism,” observed the civil rights activist Angela Davis. So just as a virus highlights our interdependence on each other in an ominous way, hope shows how togetherness is as much solution as problem. Whether developing a vaccine or wearing a mask or shopping for a relative or contacting an elderly neighbour, there is always something we humans can do for each other.</p> <p>Hope isn’t about waiting for a hypothetical future. Hope is finding the goodness in the dark and protecting it like a flame. Maybe – let’s hope big – we will emerge from this mass experience with a better idea of how we should live, just as we did after the second world war. And, in the end, we might not need ruby slippers because we have each other to lead us home.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/27/the-midnight-library-by-matt-haig-review-a-celebration-of-lifes-possibilities"">The Midnight Library</a> by Matt Haig is published by Canongate</em>.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Ella Risbridger on food: ‘When this is over, I’ll have that joy again’</strong></h2> <p>I have cooked my way through so many crises in my life: mental illness, family estrangement, a suicide attempt, the slow death of my partner and the complex grief that followed. I have found cooking to be a joy and a balm: a creative and practical distraction from pain, a way to love and be loved, a daily practice – like running or meditation – to centre a life around. It has been my reason, really, for living.</p> <p>The week we lost my partner, I made pie, surrounded by white flowers and my best people. The day he was diagnosed, my friends spooned bolognese into my mouth, as if I were a baby. I made chicken soup like medicine for sad friends";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" perhaps they are a new neighbour or a friend you lost touch with years ago. Finally, something that sounds obvious but I’ve only really grasped in the last few months is the concept of being really honest with your friends. I think we’ve all spent the last year going through the rigmarole of saying: “Oh you know, getting by!” But in the last few months I’ve gone for brutal honesty when friends ask how I am. Not only does it take the weight off my shoulders, but it lets my friends know they can do the same with me. Mollie Goodfellow is a comedy writer and journalist. Nikesh Shukla on play: ‘Lego can help you through lockdown’ I couldn’t have got through lockdown without Lego. I have been playing a lot with Lego. I’ve learned so much about myself because of Lego. I dream about Lego. Unable to attend any gigs last year, we built our own concert venue and crowd. When I was trying to figure out a scripting issue, I built the scene and played it out. When I wanted a conversation with my kids about us going back into lockdown, knowing they would take it hard, missing their family and friends as they were, I told them while we played Lego. On the floor, with my kids, each of us concentrating on whatever we’re trying to build, making suggestions, encouraging each other, playing has been a blessed oasis away from the Zooms and the empty Word document with the blinking cursor shaming me for not writing and the endless notifications and emails. Play can stimulate your imagination. If I place myself in front of a screen all day, then spend all evening working my way through nine seasons of a sitcom I’ve seen before while I doomscroll social media, I feel empty. I am passive, a passenger. Playing with my kids has been a real reminder for me to lean into my imagination, build worlds and develop characters, be out in the world within the sanctity of our home and interact with each other in unexpected ways. It alleviates the drudgerous feeling where every single day feels the same. Also, it means I get to have fun with my kids, on their level. Lego aside, we’ve also created detective mysteries for each other, dreamed up themed scavenger hunts and been superheroes rescuing the world from monster werewolves wanting to steal our teddy bears. A few weeks ago, my kids were upset, an argument had occurred and neither was talking to each other, nor would they tell me what had happened. I poured the Lego on the floor and we played. As they concentrated on what they were building, the pressure off, we were able to have an honest conversation about what had happened, all while trying to build the tallest structure we could. Every day feels the same for my kids. But playing with them has helped us all to see each day in a new light, because we don’t know what it might bring. Though it’s true that I still haven’t quite got used to the pain of standing on Lego pieces in the middle of the night.

Ask my late dad how he was, he would tell you, “Fine”. If you wanted more information, it was best to ask him how the dog was. “Oh, the dog is depressed.” My dad was doing what Freud described as projection. This is when you split off a part of you that is too shameful for you to own and project it on to someone else and you believe your stuff is their stuff. My father could not own his vulnerability, but he could dump it on his dog. I hope I would be far too self-aware to project on to my pet. I’d hate to think I was that dotty, but the magazine has just asked if they can send a photographer round. “Kevin isn’t too keen on photos,” I said.</p> <p>Our cat Kevin had been a stray and came to us from Battersea two years ago when he was around six months old. His body was the size of a can of extra-strong lager. That tubular torso would press against me all night, sometimes stretched alongside me, sometimes curled up in my armpit. In the evening, he would start on a lap but his thin body would elongate itself from your ankles to your thighs like a furry tube. He was playful, affectionate and excellent at being a cat.</p> <p>We followed the Battersea instructions of keeping him indoors for a month and then only let him out accompanied until he knew where to come back to. When he was ready for unaccompanied roaming, I tried to get a collar on him, but however tight I made it, he could spring it off. Even if he left the house with a collar on, he came back without it. Then one day he did not come back at all. The first time he went missing, he turned up at the Blacksmith and the Toffee Maker, a gastro pub half a mile from our house. He was returned to us swiftly by the landlord, who had taken him to the vet to get his microchip read. Getting Kevin microchipped was a very good idea. My fantasy is that he had chased the pub’s resident cat all the way home and then did not know how to get back.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I followed him about. I may have scared the wildlife he was stalking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How to describe how you fall in love with a cat? First, the softness of their fur and their choice of your ankles to rub around makes you melt a bit. Secondly, you get used to their presence in your home and come to rely on it for company";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We need to be ourselves with other people for most of the time, not just the person we feel we ought to be. If you are in a business environment where everyone seems to be wearing a “game-face” and therefore you feel you must wear yours too, you run the risk of feeling unsupported, isolated and disconnected.<br></p> <p> It is stressful doing something that stretches you, that you have not done before, that might not work, but not all stress is bad. Stressing yourself is a way of keeping your brain fit. No stress at all means you are not getting a mental workout. You can, though, have too much of a good thing. </p> <p>Ongoing, continuous high levels of stress lead to panic and dissociation. Dissociation is a disconnection between our thoughts, sensations, feelings and actions and is experienced as a sort of blanking out. Panic and dissociation can lead to burnout, so what can you do to avoid them?</p> <p>I believe everyone needs to develop and maintain their inner observer. Noticing what you are feeling when you are super-busy may not be your top priority, but it does need to be up there because our feelings are the lights on the dashboard.We would not think that taking out a car’s fuel-warning bulb was the best driving strategy and, in the same way, we need to observe our feelings rather than repress them. They are there to tell us when we need to rest, to play, to connect with others. When we ignore feelings, they need to shout louder, in other words, make us feel worse.</p> <p> When we are in the habit of observing our emotions, we can use them rather than be used by them. This means noticing a feeling when it begins to emerge, listening to it and taking any action that needs to be taken. When we observe a feeling, we run less chance of becoming that feeling. </p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Feelings are like employees: repress them and they will rebel, listen to them and you harness them to help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a difference between “I feel angry” and “I am angry”. The latter is a whole person definition whereas with the former, there is a part that is sitting back, observing and still available to make a decision, taking the feeling into account, without merely being a reaction to that feeling. </p> <p>To ignore feelings, not taking them into account, means risking a mutiny of emotion.

When I talk about e-bikes, I hear: “It’s cheating!” and “The point of cycling is exercise.” It’s not cheating because we are not racing, life is not a competition and neither is going to the shops. Nor does it mean you don’t exercise on an electric bike – you still have to pedal – it’s just that your pedalling can be assisted when the wind is against you or you need help up a hill. It feels like someone is giving you a push through the difficult bits. The motor can help you on the flat as well, but is <a href=""http://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/product-news/electric-bikes-uk-law-234973"">legally required</a> to cut out at 15.5mph, making an electric bike no more dangerous than an ordinary one.

I remember the excruciating shame when your father, probably meaning to be kind, said it looked better when you used cover-up rather than a plaster. “Dad, it’s a hole oozing blood and pus and don’t mention it because I’m trying to carry on as though it’s not there, OK!” Except you don’t say that, do you? You just squirm. Other people make it seem worse: it’s not their fault;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Maybe being relaxed about touch by others has something to do with your idea of self-sustainability. Knowing you need others to get by means you are less freaked out by their touch.</p> <p>I also notice the same touchy-feely nature in working-class white cultures, so maybe it’s more about community than national traits. Maybe when you stop needing the safety net of community, you stop needing to touch.</p> <p>Of course, as a guy I’m relatively free from the fear of the unwanted touch, but I can’t help lamenting that we are moving towards a world where touching another human is so rare.</p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philippa-perry"" title="""">Philippa Perry</a>: What are we Brits really afraid of?</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image element--thumbnail"" data-media-id=""023b526ae29be083f34c3b4b06485bef8eafe4c8""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/27/1445949718847/7bcbf76d-d85e-4af6-ac2b-7c594253db17-bestSizeAvailable.png"" alt=""Pilippa Perry"" width=""480"" height=""480"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>If we are putting it on a scale it doesn’t surprise me that the UK is the <a href=""http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2015-10-27/"" title="""">least touchy-feely nation</a>. The difference between loving touch and being sexual with someone is interesting. In many cultures there’s no difference between one and the other, and with many people loving touch can also be sexual touch. But if we’re really screwed up, we can do sexual touch but we don’t allow ourselves be touched lovingly.</p> <p>There’s more intimacy in loving touch. It exposes our vulnerability. If someone is allowing you to have sex with them, you don’t consider yourself as vulnerable because you’re “doing sex”, but if you let yourself be moved in a non-sexual way by loving touch you are allowing yourself to be vulnerable.</p> <p>In my work I’ve come across men who are uncomfortable with holding hands with their partners but not uncomfortable with sex";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When we spend years and years with people, we change in relationship to them. We knock up against each other, and bits rub off until we become shapes that fit. This may mean we can feel comfortable without speaking, or know what our loved one means when they give us a wink. This doesn’t mean we don’t argue with our spouse or old friends, it just means we know how to do it and still remain connected. Losing such connections feels like losing a part of yourself.</p> <p>Even at 95, I hope Bill does make a new friend who can become like an old friend, but I think it will be hard. The lonelier we get, the harder it can be to reach out.</p> <p>Loneliness used to be associated with poor social skills or being a bit odd, which is why there is a stigma and shame attached to it. But it’s important to realise that <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-do-i-meet-people-lonely-unhappy"" title="""">loneliness</a> does not happen because you’re a loser, it can affect anyone.

Or work to rekindle the friendships we already have? Sadly it’s not that easy for many. Why? Because feelings of loneliness trigger a state of hypervigilance for social threat, and when we expect social threat, we can behave in ways more likely to get us rejected. It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this hypervigilant state, the individual becomes super-sensitive to possible rejection or coolness. What happens when we look closely for something? I’m afraid we usually find it.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/17/loneliness-report-bigger-killer-obesity-lonely-people"">Loneliness is killing us – we must start treating this disease | Philippa Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This could be why people in isolation are increasingly inclined to scorn the idea of social interaction. Thinking we are somehow better than other people becomes an excuse to withdraw, as does thinking that other people are superior to us. Both of these reactive thought patterns lead to a spiral of withdrawal, and intensify the sense of social isolation. By then, it can feel very hard to volunteer somewhere, or join a group or a class, or to pick up the phone.</p> <p>Not all of us are like Bill and can find a load of potential friends through the local radio station.

He said as much on a BBC Radio Solent phone-in, and the radio station came to the rescue with an invitation to come into the studio and talk to other listeners. He was a hit, and more invitations came flooding in for Bill. It’s all very well getting this level of attention, but I would hazard a guess that what Bill really would have liked would have been to be with his wife before she got dementia, and spend time with his old friends before they died or had become too infirm to leave home. When we spend years and years with people, we change in relationship to them. We knock up against each other, and bits rub off until we become shapes that fit. This may mean we can feel comfortable without speaking, or know what our loved one means when they give us a wink. This doesn’t mean we don’t argue with our spouse or old friends, it just means we know how to do it and still remain connected. Losing such connections feels like losing a part of yourself. Even at 95, I hope Bill does make a new friend who can become like an old friend, but I think it will be hard. The lonelier we get, the harder it can be to reach out. Loneliness used to be associated with poor social skills or being a bit odd, which is why there is a stigma and shame attached to it. But it’s important to realise that loneliness does not happen because you’re a loser, it can affect anyone. Have you ever felt homesickness, unrequited love or humiliation in the face of being ignored? All these are forms of loneliness, as is the empty hollow ache we get when we long for understanding, acknowledgment and connection with our fellow humans. Loneliness is a necessary feeling, just like thirst and hunger – ignore it at your peril. We feel lonely when we need to do something about it. Loneliness is a major risk factor for premature death. Humans are not isolates, we are pack animals. Dementia, high blood pressure, alcoholism and accidents are all accelerated by loneliness, and it can be a major cause of deterioration of your mental health. Loneliness isn’t just sad, it’s dangerous. So if we know that being lonely is so bad for us, why don’t we all join evening classes and make more friends? Or work to rekindle the friendships we already have? Sadly it’s not that easy for many. Why? Because feelings of loneliness trigger a state of hypervigilance for social threat, and when we expect social threat, we can behave in ways more likely to get us rejected. It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this hypervigilant state, the individual becomes super-sensitive to possible rejection or coolness. What happens when we look closely for something? I’m afraid we usually find it. This could be why people in isolation are increasingly inclined to scorn the idea of social interaction. Thinking we are somehow better than other people becomes an excuse to withdraw, as does thinking that other people are superior to us. Both of these reactive thought patterns lead to a spiral of withdrawal, and intensify the sense of social isolation. By then, it can feel very hard to volunteer somewhere, or join a group or a class, or to pick up the phone. Not all of us are like Bill and can find a load of potential friends through the local radio station. So what can we do? First, recognise when you are lonely – don’t deny it, or judge yourself negatively for feeling it. Second, understand what it does to you: remember that it’s dangerous as a member of a social species to feel isolated. Third, learn to recognise that hypervigilant state so you can override it. Watch out for those feelings of superiority or inferiority which may just be excuses to cling to the distrust that loneliness can produce. Overriding hypervigilance will mean that you can make yourself a part of something bigger, be it a book club or a religion. If taking these steps seems impossible or overwhelming, then force yourself to take them anyway. Remember loneliness is dangerous, get help with it.

As soon as he’s got that notch on his bedpost, he’ll suddenly not be ready for a relationship right now, or simply stop texting. It’s not you, it’s him.</p> <h2>2. The vanity project</h2> <p>Even worse than the playa, because they aren’t even all that interested in sex. They check their online dating account obsessively to see how many people have “liked” their profile, and that’s really enough for them. The vanity project may get into emailing to get even more admiration, but they’re not interested in actually meeting – except for maybe via <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/24/speed-dating-experience"" title="""">speed dating</a>, but that’s only as they like counting the number of emails they get afterwards. The vanity project may well be already married.</p> <h2>3. The perfectionist</h2> <p>Harbours the romantic notion that Mr or Miss Right is out there for them – and they’ll know immediately from something they refer to as “chemistry”. They haven’t realised that perfection doesn’t come ready-made and that a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships"" title="""">relationship</a> is built up slowly. Even if they do seem to hit it off with a date, they’ll never commit or settle because there’s so much choice out there it makes them terrified of making a mistake.

The defeatist</h2> <p>Someone who has been on as many as three internet dates and has had the misfortune to fall victim of a playa, a vanity project and a perfectionist. On the basis of three unfortunate experiences, they write off everyone and anyone who may be seeking a partner using online dating. Their only hope is to strike it lucky first time because they won’t give online love a chance. Their pessimism may even put off potential partners.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote""> <blockquote> <p>The depressive should probably be looking for a therapist rather than a date</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>5.

In fact, she might ask on the first date how keen you are to settle down and start producing progeny. Encounters feel more like job interviews than dates. “What’s your sperm count?”</p> <h2>6. The depressive</h2> <p>Should probably be looking for a therapist rather than a date. They usually have a belief that with the right partner to look after them, they would feel all right. In fact, they might have ended a relationship with a perfectly nice person because they were <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/depression"" title="""">depressed</a> and rather than recognising it in themselves, thought it was to do with their ex.</p> <h2>7. The rescuer</h2> <p>They may not realise it, but they are looking for a depressive. Although this relationship may work for a bit, it usually ends in tears as the only person who can really change the depressive is themselves. And the rescuer may get resentful that, try as they might, nothing really makes a difference. They may try to change a playa as well (it never works). They too would probably be better off seeing a therapist in order to drop the habit of trying to change everyone.</p> <h2>8. The survivalist</h2> <p>The most successful internet dater, a real imperfect human being who knows that love is about acting in loving ways, as much as passive attraction. This is someone who keeps at it until they meet another such realist. They survive and thrive at internet dating because they have optimism. Even though they meet their fair share of playas, vanity projects and interviewers, they realise they cannot be the only half-decent human using a dating service, so they keep at it until they feel a glimmer of a spark.

No one was surprised. I sat the exam after only a few weeks studying Racine, Corneille, Beaumarchais, Gide, Camus and Verlaine. I never stood a chance.</p> <p>I’d spent most of the year in what was then Rhodesia, working for Amnesty, listing the prisoners held in camps by <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/21/guardianobituaries.world"">Ian Smith</a> under his breakaway apartheid government. How and why is another story, but after I was arrested and expelled, the classical couplets of Bajazet were hard to settle down to. And I didn’t.</p> <p>I thought I was done for, after a rebellious education of bad behaviour and failed exams – failed 11-plus, failed most O-levels, the black sheep my family didn’t expect to go to university.</p> <p>It took just one great teacher, Mr Stedman Jones, head of English at Holland Park comprehensive, who was determined I would pass everything, and pass the Oxford exams too. By force of character and the infectious enthusiasm of his teaching he set me on my feet. He brought the set books to life – Lear and Hamlet, Peacock, Bacon, Spenser, Milton and more. But his private passion was Jacobean revenge tragedies: Jonson, Middleton, Beaumont and Fletcher. He immersed me in their dark world.</p> <p>Alongside A-level, there was S-level, a far better paper. A-levels tried to catch you out on close textural study – but S-level invited you to spread your wings: show us what else you know, show us your best, not find out your worst. It was my chance to indulge in the romance of the Jacobeans.</p> <p>I’m so grateful to Mr Stedman Jones, not just for pulling me through the necessary exams, including into Oxford, but because he left me with a love of all the books and plays he taught. Oddly, the failed French set-books stay with me too.</p> <h2><strong>Fi Glover: My classical civilisation teacher taught me that if you are good at only one thing, make the most of that</strong><br></h2> <p>By the time I got to take my A-levels I was bored at school and I was, under a cocky exterior, incredibly fearful about what would happen after school finished. I’m afraid those two things made for a queasy cocktail and resulted in very poor A-level results (a D and a no-show) in history and music.</p> <p>But then I also got a weird and wonderful A in classical civilisation, and that was all down to the quite brilliant Mrs Rankin. She loved her subject, took no prisoners when it came to criticism but praised the hell out of me when I got things right. I loved the way she connected what could have been dry and dusty texts to the modern world. She gave me a life-long love of watching the political process at work – and tied in a life-long fascination with what makes people tick and how people deal with circumstance and fate – which is what all the Greek tragedies are about.</p> <p>I owe Mrs Rankin a huge amount because she taught me that if you are good at only one thing, then why not make sure you make the most of that? She also told me to get to a place where I was more stimulated. I did – eventually – and I owe her a lot for simply taking the time to say that.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--thumbnail"" data-media-id=""6f50524fb4254dcf55cac6ec162fbc1fe37e022c""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/28/1443434972066/18afbd20-4e1f-419f-b460-5b072a4161ac-bestSizeAvailable.png"" alt=""Lola Okolosie"" width=""480"" height=""480"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lola-okolosie""><strong>Lola Okolosie</strong></a><strong>: English A-level made me realise the subject wasn’t wishy-washy, but had real bite</strong><br></h2> <p>At the time I did my A-levels I harboured a secret ambition to become a writer.

Not really – unless I have a strict confidentiality agreement in place, I’m still indiscreet and I’d still sacrifice my dignity for art, or at least for a laugh. I found the whole thing much funnier than Donald, poor Donald, who was rather cross with me and wanted to discuss “our relationship”. He somehow managed to grab the role as victim in this scenario, a position I feel I might have had a better right to, but he won the argument and I ended up giving him a lift from Wood Green to Fulham by way of retribution. Over the course of this painful journey we realised we had different values (I, apparently, had none at all). It’s a pity the creative writing class had moved onto iambic pentameter because that journey could have the makings of another cracking diary entry.</p> <p>So what did change after this fracas? That course must have been effective because eventually I had two books published that still do OK. The books led to working as a journalist.

Donald went puce, said nothing and walked away and it slowly dawned on my fellow pupil that perhaps Donald and Hamish were one and the same, which of course, they were. Did I learn from this? Not really – unless I have a strict confidentiality agreement in place, I’m still indiscreet and I’d still sacrifice my dignity for art, or at least for a laugh. I found the whole thing much funnier than Donald, poor Donald, who was rather cross with me and wanted to discuss “our relationship”. He somehow managed to grab the role as victim in this scenario, a position I feel I might have had a better right to, but he won the argument and I ended up giving him a lift from Wood Green to Fulham by way of retribution. Over the course of this painful journey we realised we had different values (I, apparently, had none at all). It’s a pity the creative writing class had moved onto iambic pentameter because that journey could have the makings of another cracking diary entry. So what did change after this fracas? That course must have been effective because eventually I had two books published that still do OK. The books led to working as a journalist. This in turn led to working as a broadcaster, and I’ve made a series of videos with the Guardian, called What’s troubling you? Sorry, I only stuck that in as a plug. What changed was if Donald hadn’t been so forgetful, and I hadn’t been indiscreet then that fellow pupil in the class might not have managed to split me and Donald up and I wouldn’t have started to go out with him instead. But I did. And reader, I married him. He is Grayson, the father of my child. The thing that usually changes a person is another person. And when you allow yourself to be changed by another person, it’s because that person is flexible enough to be changed by you too. This is how good relationships work – mutual impact. Let enough of this into your day and then hopefully life is one big exciting adventure of discovery. That’s the theory. Donald did not want to be changed by me, not even to the extent of remembering me, whereas my next significant relationship was more mutually impactful, I think to the benefit of all concerned – even Donald, probably.;4003;NA;NA;"<a href=""profile/philippa-perry"">Philippa Perry</a>";NA;NA;NA;

Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>";"<p>We tend to disapprove of gossip, perhaps because we fear being slurred by others behind our back. Gossip today is generally assumed to be a female occupation, and is often belittled by males. Men may be more likely to be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia"" title="""">alexithymic</a> and may not understand the nuance of gossip, meaning they dismiss it as meaningless rather than admit a lack of understanding. But if we go back to the etymology of the word, we can see what gossip is really about – a <a href=""http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gossip"" title="""">person related to one in God</a>. In secular terms we may interpret this as a person with whom we have a bond, and that’s what gossip is really for. It is for bonding and, it is most certainly for both genders.</p> <p>In <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/interactive/2013/jan/26/pride-and-prejudice-jane-austen-interactive"" title="""">Pride and Prejudice</a>, Mr Bennet says: “But, Lizzie, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. <a href=""http://www.austenquotes.com/for-what-do-we/"" title="""">For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn</a>?” Jane Austen’s wry character was, of course, a lover of the ironic. He did believe, I am sure, that there was more to our existence than making sport for our neighbours, but he also knew that gossip was an important part of life and a glue that helps to bond us. Humans are pack animals: we do not thrive without attachment to others. We need a tribe, and gossip is an important ingredient in holding that tribe together.</p> <p>These days the people making the most sport for us are celebrities, but we don’t like to admit it. In a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25580932"" title="""">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Social Neuroscience, scientists outlined how they scanned people’s brains to see how they reacted to different types of gossip. Although participants in the study did not report being particularly happy upon hearing negative gossip about celebrities, the significantly enhanced neural activity in the reward system of the brain suggested that they were indeed amused.</p> <p>They were also scanned when they completed a questionnaire";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Find a sympathetic witness for what you are going through: a friend, a teacher, a school counsellor – someone whose idea of you actually reflects who you feel you really are. You can then hold on to their image of you when times are tough. And most importantly, although it feels like a lifetime, it isn’t. You will be able to walk away one day and build a new network consisting of mutual support around you.;4387;NA;NA;"<a href=""profile/philippa-perry"">Philippa Perry</a>";NA;NA;NA;

She needs to please everyone, all the time. Asked what she wants for Christmas, she will reply that she “just wants everyone to be happy”. To this end, she has been stockpiling presents since August and has cooked four different types of vegetable plus three different roasts so everyone can have their favourite. But it’s hard because the twins want to watch telly and Granny has decided everyone should play charades, so the Placator’s happiness-for-all goal is impossible. Her trouble is that she seems to imagine that if she fills everyone else’s cup with joy, then a little might just spill over the brim for her.

That’s the conclusion being reached by <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-the-midlife-crisis-1413147918"" title="""">researchers such as Susan Krauss Whitbourne of the University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. You will be delighted to know that life events and a realisation of mortality can hit you at any age, forcing you to reconsider everything you’ve ever been told, and have assumed or thought.</p> <p>Falling apart and putting yourself back together again, possibly in a different way, is not something that is more likely to happen <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-krauss-whitbourne/midlife-crisis-myth_b_2371951.html"" title="""">when you are between 45 and 55 than it is at any other age</a>.</p> <p>It seems to me from my work as a psychotherapist that we could each be placed somewhere along a line with chaos at one end and rigidity at the other. If we are way over into the chaotic end of the spectrum, we are likely to live our life from drama to crisis, and you may find that labelling your experience of those years “a midlife crisis” helps you construct a narrative around it. If, on the other hand, you are very rigid and rule bound, and keep all your feelings under lock and key, there may come a time when these feelings rebel against their imprisonment and break free. If this happens during middle age, you too may find it meaningful to call that “a midlife crisis”.</p> <p>I believe, though, that we are too fond of labelling our experience with a diagnosis, as it helps us to disown it to think it of it as something that has invaded us, like a virus, rather than as an integrated part of ourselves and our development that we can do something about.</p> <p>We don’t just reach adulthood and stop developing. We are kept emotionally fit by an ability to respond as our circumstances, our environment and our body changes. We have to keep learning, adapting and working with the ebb and flow of life’s circumstances rather than being disappointed when immovable objects don’t bend to us. The only certainty is change, so if we can be aware of what is likely to happen and plan for it, and accept that not everything can be planned for, it is possible that crises can be kept to a minimum at any stage in life.</p> <p>As well as what are sometimes experienced as inner demons such as anxiety, depression or paranoia, there are stressful aspects to every age: getting into university, getting a job you want, sticking at a job you hate, conflict, wanting a mate, drought, wanting children, the trap of baby jail, financial worries, housing worries, loneliness, divorce, relevance, meaning, striving for bigger accomplishments, more money, later babies, stronger bodies, better sex, smoother skin. By middle age, you either face up to the fact that these things might not matter so much, and you’ve found different meanings, or you decide they matter very much but you are a failure because you haven’t achieved them.</p> <p>Or, worse, you have achieved them but you don’t feel the relief you would have supposed they would bring. Perhaps we may respond to these pressures with a crisis, but it is just as likely to happen at 25 as it is at 55. And at any age we can be faced with the challenge of having to reconcile our inner picture of ourselves and our life to the outer reality.</p> <p>To manage stress we develop certain coping mechanisms. Some may use talking things over openly";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The not so good news is that those who had were approximately twice as likely to experience depression, anxiety and to self-harm than those who had not. We hear a lot about bullying and what a problem it is, and the talk tends to be: bullies equal bad and victims equal good. But, of course, it is more complex than that. A bully doesn’t bully for fun.

These same children were then asked about their mental health when they were aged 18. The good news is that most children said they had not experienced such bullying by their siblings. The not so good news is that those who had were approximately twice as likely to experience depression, anxiety and to self-harm than those who had not. We hear a lot about bullying and what a problem it is, and the talk tends to be: bullies equal bad and victims equal good. But, of course, it is more complex than that. A bully doesn’t bully for fun. It may look like that, but actually a bully bullies in order to solve a problem – usually, to gain equilibrium where an imbalance is felt. The first time an older child gets knocked off balance is often when the new baby is born. The family dynamic changes for the older child, and usually for the worse. They have feelings about this – they feel they are a victim. It feels terribly hard for parents to validate how their oldest child is feeling because they hate them feeling like that.

Aren't they supposed to be as one? Aren't the people who separate love and sex guilty of a lack of essential integration?

The headline might now be a private language evolved from shared memories, a deeper real knowledge and appreciation of each other and a willingness to continue to invest time and energy.

You will pass through an extraordinary amount of time, and cross the world, as you move between buildings from the 12th century to the modern day, from old English markets to modern Chinese restaurants.</p> <p>I'm a wanderer. We are so used to reading maps and having maps with us all the time, but wandering cultivates the mind. I love that feeling when I don't know where I am: all your senses become heightened and you are aware of what is happening around you.</p> <p>All walks begin somewhere that you know. From that familiar starting place, you will head down streets you recognise, until you find ones you only know a bit. Keep wandering, and if you're lucky you'll realise you've arrived somewhere new. Your understanding of the geography of the city grows as streets link up, and you can connect up different areas in your mind.</p> <p>Walking through a city, you will experience more than you would in a landscape that's more uniform. The streets and buildings may not change often, but there is a cast of people that do. You may not witness the same beautiful vistas that you would in the countryside, but you do get an endless procession of interesting faces.</p> <p>As you walk, remember to look up. Near Baker Street in London, there is a block of 1930s flats with a whole load of train parts such as buffers and couplers embedded in the building. In New York, you might look up and find yourself at the bottom of a deep, manmade canyon, unlike anything you've seen before – if you come from a small town, like me.</p> <p>People often ask me my favourite place in Britain. I don't like the idea of a favourite static spot – I have favourite routes. In London, walk down Marchmont Street, past Judd Books, cut across and sneak through the British Museum.

When faced with such an existential question I usually go to my favourite psychologist, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten"" title="""">Jane Austen</a>. ""'Tis too much … by far too much … Oh! Why is not everybody as happy?"" says Jane Bennett on first seeing her sister after Mr Bingley had proposed in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice"" title="""">Pride and Prejudice</a>. Jane is a caring person, very mindful of others' feelings and at this moment she is very happy indeed. But Jane is aware that others around her may not be as happy and that it may be possible that she is too happy for them.</p> <p>We may sometimes make a brave show of pretending not to care what others think, but who would not, like Jane, be mindful if their mood was substantially different, was too happy, for others in their group? The things that make us happiest are our social relationships – happiness is a good friend. And the more empathetic we are to others the better friendships we are likely to have. This means we need to be able to relate to others' states of being when they are less than happy and if we are unable or unwilling to do this then that is what I would call being too happy.</p> <p>Jane, of course, has nothing really to worry about. She may have feared being too happy, but others are so happy for her that her happiness is neither too much for them nor is it for us.</p> <p>We might also be so happy that we are not worrying enough about everyday concerns. When Jane's father, Mr Bennett, makes a joke about the personalities of Jane and Bingley he could be hinting at the disadvantages of too much happiness brought about by being so easy-going.

Because of this tradition, other people will be in the same boat as us so we will have some support and, because everyone will be asking us around this time of year what our new year's resolution will be, we have an extra incentive to stick to our resolution because we will have told other people about it and may not want to look weak in their eyes.</p> <p>It's odd how difficult embracing improving changes can be. A hit of dopamine reinforces a bad habit and we'll tell ourselves any old baloney to get another hit. In addition to this, what is familiar, automatic and comfortable feels right, even if it harms us. So to get the extra help of a ritual makes it more likely that we'll see it through.</p> <h2><strong>Euan Ferguson, <em>Observer </em>writer</strong><br><strong> </strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>There's certainly no denying that giving up even one dopamine-rich comfort habit – yum <em>yum</em>, chortle your happy little receptors – needs all the help it can humanly get. Thus my first, and possibly most massive, objection to new year's resolutions.</p> <p>The body atrophies exponentially, so age hardly matters: a 1am bedtime after a polite but ill-advised last port will still have left you, relatively, ravaged.

In an attempt to get to the bottom of the question once and for all, the Guardian has gathered writers from the fields of science, psychotherapy, literature, religion and philosophy to give their definition of the much-pondered word.</p> <h2>The physicist: 'Love is chemistry'</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-457610840""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/28/1438102812850/Jim-Al-Khalili.jpg"" alt=""Jim Al-Khalili"" width=""140"" height=""140"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>Biologically, love is a powerful neurological condition like hunger or thirst, only more permanent. We talk about love being blind or unconditional, in the sense that we have no control over it. But then, that is not so surprising since love is basically chemistry. While lust is a temporary passionate sexual desire involving the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and oestrogen, in true love, or attachment and bonding, the brain can release a whole set of chemicals: pheromones, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin. However, from an evolutionary perspective, love can be viewed as a survival tool – a mechanism we have evolved to promote long-term relationships, mutual defence and parental support of children and to promote feelings of safety and security.</p> <p>• Jim Al-Khalili is a theoretical physicist and science writer</p> <h2>The psychotherapist: 'Love has many guises'</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-457610841""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/23/1330025812343/Philippa-Perry.jpg"" alt=""Philippa Perry"" width=""140"" height=""140"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>Unlike us, the ancients did not lump all the various emotions that we label ""love"" under the one word. They had several variations, including:</p> <p><em>Philia</em> which they saw as a deep but usually non-sexual intimacy between close friends and family members or as a deep bond forged by soldiers as they fought alongside each other in battle. <em>Ludus</em> describes a more playful affection found in fooling around or flirting. <em>Pragma</em> is the mature love that develops over a long period of time between long-term couples and involves actively practising goodwill, commitment, compromise and understanding. <em>Agape</em> is a more generalised love, it's not about exclusivity but about love for all of humanity. <em>Philautia</em> is self love, which isn't as selfish as it sounds. As Aristotle discovered and as any psychotherapist will tell you, in order to care for others you need to be able to care about yourself. Last, and probably least even though it causes the most trouble, <em>eros</em> is about sexual passion and desire. Unless it morphs into philia and/or pragma, eros will burn itself out.</p> <p>Love is all of the above. But is it possibly unrealistic to expect to experience all six types with only one person. This is why family and community are important.</p> <p>• Philippa Perry is a psychotherapist and author of Couch Fiction</p> <h2>The philosopher: 'Love is a passionate commitment'</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-457610842""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/julian_baggini_140x140.jpg"" alt=""Julian Baggini"" width=""140"" height=""140"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>The answer remains elusive in part because love is not one thing. Love for parents, partners, children, country, neighbour, God and so on all have different qualities. Each has its variants – blind, one-sided, tragic, steadfast, fickle, reciprocated, misguided, unconditional. At its best, however, all love is a kind a passionate commitment that we nurture and develop, even though it usually arrives in our lives unbidden. That's why it is more than just a powerful feeling. Without the commitment, it is mere infatuation. Without the passion, it is mere dedication. Without nurturing, even the best can wither and die.</p> <p>• Julian Baggini is a philosopher and writer</p> <h2>The romantic novelist: 'Love drives all great stories'</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-457610843""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/13/1355400070949/Jojo.jpg"" alt=""Jojo"" width=""140"" height=""140"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>What love is depends on where you are in relation to it. Secure in it, it can feel as mundane and necessary as air – you exist within it, almost unnoticing. Deprived of it, it can feel like an obsession";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
